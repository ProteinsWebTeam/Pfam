    DAS Widgets - A Javascript library which is used to show multiple sequence alignments, positional features on a protein sequence and PDB structures in a more intuitive way.
    This library consists of three widgets named Alignment viewer, Feature viewer and Structure viewer which are used to show alignments, draw features and  display structures respectively. 
    It also has a helper class called WidgetTagger which tags all the widgets together in an interactive manner. 
    This documentation is intended for developers to explain the working and to show the ways to embed these widgets in a web page.
    It also relies on certain other javascript libraries which are mentioned in the requirements section.

      <h3>Alignment Viewer</h3>
      Visualizing large scale alignments was never easy and have never ending issues. This widget is one such attempt to address a particular issue which is to display massive alignments in the browser by loading them dynamically when needed. You can initialize the widget by providing following parameters,
     
     <ol>
       <li>A reference to HTML DOM element,</li>
       <li>Uniprot accession identifier</li>
       <li>Datasource name ( DAS source name )</li>
       <li>Total rows in the alignment.</li>
       <li>URL to make a request.( The server returns the data in JSON format and the response JSON is shown below )</li>
       <li>Total number of rows to be displayed in the window ( optional ).</li>
     </ol>
     
     <h4>Example:</h4><pre>var alignments = new AlignmentViewer( parent, acc, dsn, size, url, rows );</pre>
     
     <h4>Working:</h4> The following events takes place in the sequential order while you initialize the widget,
     
     <ul>
       <li>CSS files required to render the alignments are loaded from the server using YAHOO's GET utility.</li>
       <li>HTML elements are created and are added as child elements to the input parent element.</li>
       <li>Custom built LiveGrid object is initialized, which makes GET request to the input URL.</li>
         <p></p>
         <ol>
           <li>Javascript library which provides a behavior for connecting an HTML element to a live datasource via YAHOO's GET request.</li>
           <li>Creates a scroller which acts a live navigator for making requests.</li>
           <li>Automatically populates the response alignments to the HTML element.</li>
           <li>Data buffering and Event registration strategies are implemented to improve performance.</li>
         </ol>
     </ul>
     
     <h4>Response JSON format</h4>
     When you make a request to the server, it has to return the data as a JSON string in the following format to allow
     the library to render the data in the browser, 
     <pre>
       var alignments = {"data":{
         "rows":[
             {"value":"html span tag","key":"html span tag"},
             {"value":"html span tag","key":"html span tag"} 
            ],
          "rowcount":"integer",
          "offset":"integer"
        },
        "storeAlignments":{"accession1/start-end":"MAMAMRSTFAARV.GAKPAVRGARPASR.MSCMA","accession2/start-end":"MSMAVRSSFAARVAGARPAVRAARPSARTVSVNA"}
      }

    <div id="featureViewer">
      <h3>Feature Viewer</h3>
      
      This widget gets the positional features for a uniprot accession in a specific JSON format and uses Pfam Domain Graphics code to draw those returned features in the browser using the HTML canvas element. You can initialise the widget by providing the following parameters,
      
      <ol>
       <li>A reference to HTML DOM element,</li>
       <li>Uniprot accession identifier</li>
       <li>List of DAS sources to get the features ( provide das source unique identifiers )</li>
       <li>URL to make a request.( The server returns the data in JSON format and the response JSON is shown below )</li>
       <li>An options hash with extra parameters which can contain following keys in it:</li>
       <ol>
         <li>Yincrement - Pixel size difference between two das tracks drawn ( default is 10px ).</li>
         <li>resWidth - Pixel width corresponding to aminoacid residue ( default is 1 pixel per residue ).</li>
         <li>tipStyle - if you intend to use your own tip style please look at the documentation of <a href="http://www.nickstakenburg.com/projects/prototip2/">Prototip2</a> for creating custom styles.</li>
       </ol>
     </ol>
     
     <strong>Example:</strong> <pre>var featureviewer = new FeatureViewer( parent, acc, sources, url );</pre>
     
     <h4>Working:</h4> The following events takes place in the sequential order while you initialize the widget,
     
     <ul>
       <li>CSS files required to render the features are loaded from the server using YAHOO's GET utility.</li>
       <li>A GET request is made to retrieve all the positional features present on the input accession.</li>
       <li>If the request succeeds, new HTML elements are created and added as child elements to the input parent element.</li>
       <li>The das features are parsed and are provided as an argument to the Pfam Domain Graphics code to draw them in canvas element.</li>
       <li>Event listeners are added which add the tooltips functionality to the protein features.</li> 
       
     </ul>
     
     <h4>Response JSON format</h4>
     
     When you make a request to the server, it has to return the data as a JSON string in the following format to allow      the library to render the data in the browser, 
     <pre>

      <h3>Structure Viewer</h3>
      
      This widget gets the PDB structures which are similar to the input uniprot accession in a specific JSON format and then uses JMOL library to create an applet in the browser to show the 3D structure. You can initialize the widget by providing the following parameters,
      
      <ol>
       <li>A reference to HTML DOM element,</li>
       <li>Uniprot accession identifier</li>

     <h4>Working:</h4> The following events takes place in the sequential order while you initialize the widget,
     
     <ul>
       <li>A GET request is made to retrieve all the structures which are similar to the input accession.</li>
       <li>If the request succeeds, Jmol applet is created and the PDB structure is loaded by using Jmol command.</li>
       <li>If more than one structures are similar, then a drop-down box is created by listing the structures.</li>
       <li> Event listeners are added, in cases where different structures are selected, which is then loaded in the applet.</li>

     <h3>Widget Tagger</h3>
      
      This is a javascript object which provides interactivity between the widgets. It adds event listeners for click and mouse move to the widgets and then triggers a series of responses, based on those events. You can initialize the object by providing the following parameters,
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Alignment object.</li>
        <li>Options hash which should atleast have parameters for one other widget. ( Either Feature viewer or Structure viewer )</li>
      </ol>
    
      <strong>Note:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>If you wish to enable FeatureViewer, you need to provide the following keys and its value, featureParent, featureSources, featureURL.</li>
        <li>If you wish to enable StructureViewer, you need to provide the folllowing keys and its value, structureParent, structureURL, structureJmolURL.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <strong>Example:</strong> <pre> var widgetTagger = new WidgetTagger( alignObj, options );</pre>

      <h4>Working:</h4>  The following events takes place in the sequential order while you initialize the object,
      
      <ul>
        <li>A watch dog functionality is added which waits until the alignments response is loaded in the browser.</li>
        <li>An Event listener for 'click' is added to the list of accessions shown in the alignments response.</li>
        <li>Using the accession and depending upon the input options, either Feature viewer or Structure Viewer is loaded.</li>
    	  <li>Another watch dog functionality is loaded which waits for the enabled viewers to be loaded.</li>
        <li>If Feature Viewer is enabled,  a mouse move listener is added to the displayed protein features.</li>
        <ul>  
          <li>When mouse is moved over the protein features corresponding column in the alignment viewer is highlighted and the corresponding residue in the structure is highlighted, if the viewer is enabled.</li>
