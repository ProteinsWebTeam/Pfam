# This script is designed to take jobs entered into the web_user database
# and run them.  This dequeuer will run non-interactive jobs. This is heavily
# tied to the WTSI LSF queue and will require tweaking for those wishing to run
# locally.  This performs some downweighting of users, but this is tied to LSF.
# If the config does not have a thirdParty queue set, then the jobs will be run by
# this dequeuer.
#
# The jobs that are non-interactive are:
# 1. single DNA sequence searches
# 2. batch protein searches
#
# In this script, there are three parts to the job:
# 1. Get the query data into a file so it is on the local machine.
# 2. Run the executable - pfam_scan.pl or pfamdna_search.pl
# 3. Once the job has finished the results are emailed to the users and entered in the database.
#
# There are no reasons that these could not be combined, but we use the pfam_scan.pl script elsewhere 
# and want maintain it's current functionality. The fasta file writing in not performed in this
# dequeuer compared with fast- or hmmer- dequeues as at WTSI we use a third party LSF queue,
# and machine that this job runs on is different to the execution machine.
