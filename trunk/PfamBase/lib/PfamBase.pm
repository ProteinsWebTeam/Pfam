=head1 NAME

PfamBase - base class for the Pfam group website application classes

=cut

package PfamBase;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for catalyst web applications in the Pfam group. It's
intended to set up the common features of the various sites, with site-specific
configuration being done in sub-classes, one for each site.

# a useful trick to get Catalyst to confess errors on startup, rather than
# simply dying with a cryptic error about barewords
#use Carp; $SIG{__DIE__} = \&Carp::confess;

# load common plugins

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration is done through a series of external "Apache-style"
configuration files. All that we do here is configure the L<Config::General>
module so that it will look along relative paths and will allow Apache-style
"include" directives, both of which we need to load various configuration files
into the main site config.

C style comments have been disabled in the config since they wont allow the use
of wild cards in the robots.txt urls.

__PACKAGE__->config( 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' => {
    driver => { 
       General => { -IncludeRelative  => 1,
                    -UseApacheInclude => 1,
                    -CComments        => 0 }
    }
  }
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_cache_enabled

Returns true if the configuration parameter C<enable_cache> is defined and is
set to a true value. Used by the PageCache plugin to decide if it should step
in to cache a page/serve a page from cache.

If C<enable_cache> is true, page caching will be enabled.

sub is_cache_enabled {
  my ( $c ) = @_;
  return ( exists $c->config->{enable_cache} and $c->config->{enable_cache} );
}
