=head2 METHODS

=head2 begin : Private

Sets up the stash for all types of search.

=cut

sub begin : Private {
  my( $this, $c ) = @_;

  # tell the navbar where we are
  $c->stash->{nav} = 'search';
  
  # tell the layout template to disable the summary icons
  $c->stash->{iconsDisabled} = 1;
  
  # decide what format to emit. The default is HTML, in which case
  # we don't set a template here, but just let the "end" method on
  # the Section controller take care of us
  $c->stash->{output_xml} = ( $c->req->param('output') || '' ) eq 'xml';

}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head2 queue_search_transaction : Private

Queues a search job. This requires new rows to be added to both the job_history
and the job_stream tables. We add these in a transaction block, rolling back if
either of the two fails. Adds the DBIC ResultSet from the job_history table to
the stash and returns 1 if the submission is successful, returns 0 otherwise.

=cut

  my ( $this, $c ) = @_;
  
  # set up an anonymous code block to define a transaction. We want to make sure
  # that we can add a row to both tables before we know that this job has been 
  # successfully queued

  # somewhere to stuff the rows from the job_history and job_stream tables, 
  # if we get them
  my ( $job_history, $job_stream );

=head2 formatTerms : Private

Inherited by the search plugins, this action formats the query terms to add
wildcard and fulltext operators to each word in the list. This base
implementation just prepends a "+" (require that the word is present in every
returned row; necessary for "IN BOOLEAN MODE" queries) and appends a "*"
(wildcard) to each term.

This method should be over-ridden by plugin search classes if they
need some other processing to be performed on the search terms.

=cut

sub formatTerms : Private {
  my( $this, $c ) = @_;

  $c->stash->{terms} =
    join " ", map { $_ = "+$_*" } split /[^A-Za-z0-9_-]/, $c->stash->{rawQueryTerms};
