=head1 NAME

PfamWeb::Controller::Search::Keyword - a keyword search engine for the site

=cut

package PfamBase::Controller::Search::Keyword;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This controller reads a list of search plugins from the application
configuration and forwards to each of them in turn, collects the
results and hands off to a template to format them as a results page.

=head2 run_searches : Private

This method is handed the name of a set of searches as its first
argument. It retrieves the list of search plugins for that search set
and runs each one in turn. For each plugin it calls the following methods:

=over

=item o C<Plugin::formatTerms>

Intended to convert the simple user input string from the URL into a
suitable query term for the DB. There's a basic version of this method
on this class but plugins can override that with their own version if
they need to do some other processing.

=item o C<Plugin::process>

Executes the database query and returns the results as a L<DBIC
ResultSet|DBIx::Class::ResultSet>.

=item o C<Search::merge_results>

Walks the L<ResultSet|DBIx::Class::ResultSet> and adds the results to
the results of the whole query.

=back

Plugins can run as many queries as necessary, returning the results as
an array of references to DBIC L<ResultSets|DBIx::Class::ResultSet>.
The results from multiple C<ResultSets> are merged in the order that
they were received, so that results from later queries will override
those from earlier ones.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head2 merge_results : Private

Merges the results of an individual query into the set of results for
the whole search. The Pfam-A accession is used as the hash key, so it
needs to be present in the results of the plugin queries. Also keeps
track of the number of hits for each plugin query.

If the plugin returns an array of ResultSets, walks down it and merges in each
one in turn.

=cut

sub merge_results : Private {
  my ( $this, $c, $pluginName, $results ) = @_;

  if ( ref $results eq 'ARRAY' ) {
    foreach my $rs ( @$results ) {
      $c->forward( 'merge', [ $pluginName, $rs ] );
    }
  }
  else {
    $c->forward( 'merge', [ $pluginName, $results ] );
  }
}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 NON-ACTION METHODS

=head2 _computeScore

Calculates a simple score for each hit, based on which plugin
generated the hit.

The score is calculated according to the order of the plugins from
the config, treating the first one in the list - probably the PfamA
table search - as the most significant, e.g.

 if the order of the plugins is Pfam -> Pdb -> Seq_info -> GO,
 the score is 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15

 if the Seq_info plugin doesn't generate a hit, the score is 8 + 4 +
 0 + 1 = 13, and that hit will sort lower in the results than the
 one above.

Since it's called once per hit, this method is implemented as a
regular perl function, rather than a Catalyst action, so it's called
directly instead of using $c->forward.

=cut

sub _computeScore {
  my ( $this, $c, $row ) = @_;

  my $score = 0;
  my $factor = 1;
  foreach my $pluginName ( @{ $c->stash->{pluginsArrayReversed} } ) {
    $score  += $factor if $row->{query}->{$pluginName};
    $factor *= 2;
  }
  $row->{score} = $score;
}
