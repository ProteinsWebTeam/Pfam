=head1 METHODS

=head2 check_unique : Private

Queries the web_user database to check if the current sequence has been
submitted by this user, with the same search options, within the last "n" hours,
where n is set in the configuration. If this is a duplicate search, we
return 1, otherwise 0;

=head2 parse_upload : Private

Parses the uploaded file and, if it's valid, copies it to the stash. Returns 1
if the upload passed validation, 0 otherwise. Error messages explaining the
failure will be returned in the stash, with the key "searchError".
