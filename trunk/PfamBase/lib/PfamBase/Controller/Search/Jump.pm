=head1 NAME

PfamWeb::Controller::Jump - guess the type of entry that the user wants to see

=cut

package PfamBase::Controller::Search::Jump;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for "jump" searching classes in specific applications.
The sub-classes must provide, at a minimum, a private C<guess> method, which
should:

=over 4

=item determine the C<Action> to which the request should be forwarded

=item forward to the guessed action, and

=item return the action

If the L<jump> method finds that the L<forward> returns undef, it returns
an error message saying that the guess failed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 jump : Path

Tries to find the URL for the specified entry accession or ID. If the
"entryType" parameter is specified and if the value is found in the
configuration, we look only for that particualr type of entry. If no "entryType"
is specified, we'll look for any type.

=cut

sub jump : Path {
  my( $this, $c ) = @_;

  # de-taint the entry ID or accession
  my ( $entry ) = $c->req->param('entry') =~ /^([\w\-_\s()\.]+)$/;
  $entry ||= '';
  $c->log->debug( "Search::Jump::jump: called with entry |$entry|" )
    if $c->debug;

  # strip off leading and trailing whitespace
  $entry =~ s/^\s*(.*?)\s*$/$1/;
  $c->log->debug( "Search::Jump::jump: trimmed entry to |$entry|" )
    if $c->debug;

  # bail immediately if there's no valid entry given
  unless( $entry ) {
    $c->stash->{error} = 'No valid accession or ID';
    return;
  }

  # now we know we have an entry. See if the caller specified the type of that
  # entry. If it did, we don't bother trying to guess the type, but just
  # redirect straight to the appropriate URL
  my $entry_type;
  if( $c->req->param('type') ) {
    $entry_type = $this->{jumpTargets}->{ $c->req->param('type') };
    $c->log->debug( 'Search::Jump::jump: looking for entry type: |'
                    . ( $entry_type || '' ) . '|' ) if $c->debug
  }

  # let's guess !
  my $action = $c->forward( 'guess', [ $entry, $entry_type ] );

  if( $action ) {
    $c->log->debug( "Search::Jump::jump: we've made a guess; redirecting to |$action|" )
      if $c->debug;
    $c->stash->{url} = $c->uri_for( "/$action", $entry );
  } else {
    $c->log->debug( "Search::Jump::jump: couldn't guess entry type..." )
      if $c->debug;

    # set the error message differently according to whether we were trying to
    # "look up" and entry or guess the type
    $c->stash->{error} = $entry_type ? 'Entry not found' : "Couldn't guess entry";
  }

}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head2 end : Private

Returns either a text/plain response with the guessed URL in the body, or an
error response (status 400) with the error message in the body.

If the C<redirect> parameter is set to 1, rather than simply returning the URL
or an error message, we set the redirect header and the user is redirected
straight to the guessed URL or, if we couldn't guess a URL, to the index page.
