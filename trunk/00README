This is the catalyst application for approving wikipedia article revisions,
prior to their inclusion in the Pfam/Rfam websites. 

The application requires Catalyst 5.8+ and several other non-standard 
modules (all available from CPAN). The configuration file in this directory
should be modified to provide the database connection parameters for the
wiki_approve database.

Start the server using the "run_server.sh" script. Configure the PERL5LIB
environment variable to add the directory with catalyst and the other
non-standard modules, and to give the location of the configuration file.

NOTE

In the Pfam/Rfam installation, catalyst itself has been patched to prevent
passwords being echoed in debug logs. If you run the app using a different
catalyst installation, and if you enable debug mode, passwords will be echoed
in the log.
