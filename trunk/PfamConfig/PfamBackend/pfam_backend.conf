# This is the configuration file for the queues that control the backend compute for the
# pfam website.  There are currently three queues, hmmer, fast and slow.
# The hmmer queue is deticated to running fast single sequence searches.
# The fast queue runs really quick jobs that take only a few seconds and where
# the results are required to be interactive.
# The slow queue runs jobs that are performed asynchronously, with the ensuing
# results being mailed to the user. As these jobs are fairly CPU intensive,
# you may want the slowDequeuer to act simple as a broker to a third party queue.
#
# This configuration files also contains connection information for the webuser database
# that holds all of the job information.
