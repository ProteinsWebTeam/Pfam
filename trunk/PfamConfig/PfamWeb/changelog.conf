      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 22 and 23</h3>
      <p>
        Release 23.0 contains a total of 10340 families, with 1063 new
        families and 52 families killed since the latest release. 73.75% of
        all proteins in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam
        domain. 51.22% of all residues in the sequence database fall within
        Pfam domains. Pfam 23.0 is based on UniProt release 12.5, a
        composite of Swiss-Prot release 54.5 and TrEMBL release 37.5.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 21 and 22</h3>
      <p>
        This is the new Pfam website, running on Pfam release 22.0. 
        Release 22.0 contains a total of 9318 families, with 380 new
        families and 19 families killed since the latest release. 73.23% of
        all proteins in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam
        domain. 50.79% of all residues in the sequence database fall within
        Pfam domains. Pfam 22.0 is based on UniProt release 9.7, a
        composite of Swiss-Prot release 51.7 and TrEMBL release 34.7. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The only change in this release is that Phobius has been used to
        calculate both signal peptides and transmembrane regions, instead of 
        signalp and tmhmm.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 20 and 21</h3>

      <p>
        Release 21.0 contains a total of 8957 families, with 669 new families 
        and 8 families killed since the latest release. 73.92% of all proteins 
        in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam domain. 51.48% of all 
        residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pfam now contains the UniProt versions for each sequence in the format 
        of accession.version as used by UniProt. This should allow users to 
        perform a complete audit between release.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also a number of additional tables in the RDB. Many of these 
        have been introduced as part of the overhaul of the database that has
        been performed in preparation for the new Pfam website (UK). Some of 
        these new tables will replace some of the existing tables in the next 
        release.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also removed solvent accessibility from the alignments as the 
        consensus lines produced were often misleading when combining 
        information from different structures. For example, a dimer versus 
        a monomer.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 19 and 20</h3>
  
      <p>
        Release 20.0 contains a total of 8296 families, with 123 new
        families and 10 families deleted since the last release. 73.88% of
        all proteins in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam
        domain. 51.57% of all residues in the sequence database fall
        within Pfam domains.

    1205932023 <<EOF
     
      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 18 and 19</h3>
  
      <p>
        Pfam 19.0 is based on UniProt 6.1 (a composite of SWISSPROT
        release 48.1 and SP-TrEMBL release 31.1). This composite
        database is called Pfamseq 19. Pfamseq 19 is available on the
        FTP site. Pfam 19.0 contains a total of 8183 entries, with 223
        new entries since the last release. 73.70% of all proteins in
        pfamseq 19 contain a match to at least one Pfam entry. 51.16% of
        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.
      </p>

      <h3>Format Change</h3>
  
      <p>
         The active site markup in Pfam has changed. The feature name AS
         is now reserved for active sites that are not annotated in the
         Swiss-Prot feature table as being probable, potential or by
         similarity.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Pfam predicts a residue to be an active site residue if it
        aligns in a Pfam alignment with a Swiss-Prot annotated active
        site, and is of the same amino acid type. Active sites which
        are predicted by Pfam are given the feature name pAS.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Active site residues which are annotated in Swiss-Prot as being
        probable, potential or by similarity are marked as predicted
        active sites, as long as they do no overlap with a Pfam
        predicted active site. Active sites which are annotated as
        probable, potential or by similarity by Swiss-Prot are given the
        feature name sAS.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In all cases, active sites are marked with an asterix. Below is
        an example:
      </p>   
      <pre>
      #=GR ODP2_AZOVI/418-637 AS        ...........*..............
      #=GR Q5KEQ8_CRYNE/111-270 pAS     ...........*..............
      #=GR YN14_YEAST/124-327 sAS       ........*.................

        Pfam 18.0 is based on UniProt 5.0 (a composite of SWISSPROT
        release 47.0 and SP-TrEMBL release 30.0). This composite
        database is called Pfamseq 18. Pfamseq 18 is available on the
        FTP site. Pfam 18.0 contains a total of 7973 entries, with 130
        new entries since the last release. 75.28% of all proteins in
        pfamseq 18 contain a match to at least one Pfam entry. 53.14% of
        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Format Change</h3>
    
      <p>
        In previous versions of Pfam, nested domains in alignments were
        masked out by &quot;X&quot;s. This masking has been removed in
        version 18.0.

        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.
      </p>
    
        <h3>New clans</h3>
    
      <p>
        Since the last release, we have added over 70 new clans -
        groupings of related families. To coincide with this we have
        revised our clan pages. Each clan page now additionally contains
        links to a clan membership relationship diagram and an alignment
        of the clan members SEED alignments.
      </p>
    
      <h3>New graphical views</h3>
    
      <p>
        After initial deployment and testing of this release we will
        switch over to our new graphical domain images. A preview can be
        seen on our home page. More details will follow the switch
        over.

      <p>
        Pfam 13.0 is based on UniProt 1.4 (a composite of SWISSPROT
        release 42.12 and SP-TrEMBL release 25.12). This composite
        database is called Pfamseq 13. Pfamseq 13 is available on the

        Pfam entry. 52.7% of all residues in the sequence database fall
        within Pfam entries.
      </p>
    
      <h3>iPfam</h3>
    
      <p>
        Released during the last release, a new resource called iPfam
        was made available. iPfam contains infromation about known
        domain-domain interactions at the residue and atom levels.
        There are loads of new and exciting features in this new section
        on the website, which are described further in the iPfam
        section. The underlying relational database files are available
        on the FTP site.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Clans</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam release 13 sees the introduction of Clans. Clans are
        groupings of Pfam families that we believe have arisen from a
        single evolutionary origin. Evidence of their evolutionary
        relationship comes from their similar tertiary structures, or
        when structures are not available, by common sequence motifs. As
        the members within a clan are allowed to overlap, the families
        within a clan are allowed to compete for domain hits. Hence, it
        is possible to obtain multiple significant hits to more than one
        of the families within the clan.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Versions in the HMMs</h3>
    
      <p>
        In the flatfiles and when HMMs are downloads, Pfam families now
        have a version number after the accession number. The version
        number is incremented when the HMM changes. This feature is of
        particular use for genome annotation such that only changed
        models need to be researched against the genome. The version
        numbers are obsolete for the website.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 11 and 12</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam 12.0 is based in a composite of SWISSPROT release 42.5 and
        SP-TrEMBL release 25.6. This composite database is called
        Pfamseq 12. Pfamseq 12 is available on the FTP site. Pfam 12.0
        contains a total of 7316 entries, with 65 new entries and 2
        entries deleted since the last release. 73.8% of all proteins in
        Pfamseq 12 contain a match to at least one Pfam entry. 52.7% of
        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 9 and 10</h3>
    
      <h3>Alignment mode</h3>
    
      <p>
        The previous major release, Pfam 7.0, introduced full alignments
        that were composed of matches from searches with both the ls and
        fs HMMs. In the majority of cases full length global matches
        (i.e. sequence matches to the ls HMM) are taken first, followed
        by the fragment matches. However, in some cases, one of two
        other options are used; the matches can be ordered by score or
        partial matches are taken before global matches. The AM line in
        the build lines section has been introduced in this release to
        inform the user which alignment method was used to build the
        full alignment.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Context Domains</h3>
    
      <p>
        This release of Pfam also includes the full implementation of
        Context Domains. Context domains are matches to a Pfam HMM that
        score below the gathering threshold, but based on the similarity
        of the domain architecture to other sequences has been marked up
        as likely matches. More information is available.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Nested Domains</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam 8.0 also allows some overlaps between families when one
        domain is nested within another. Such overlaps are tightly
        controlled and are only allowed when it is biologically
        correct. The overlapping family is indicated by the NE line and
        the NL indicates the location of the nested domain. More
        information is available.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Alignment mark up</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam alignments are now supplied with the consensus sequence for
        the alignment. In all cases a threshold of 60% is used (i.e. 60%
        or above of the amino acids in this column belong to this class
        of residue). The program used was based on the Consensus program
        by Nigel Brown at EMBL.

        Pfam 7.0 is based on a composite of SWISSPROT release 40 and
        SP-TrEMBL release 18. This composite database is called Pfamseq
        7. Pfamseq 7 is available on the FTP site.Pfam 7.0 contains a

        being deleted.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Links to the HOMSTRAD and SYSTERS database have been added. GO
        terms for each family have been derived from the GO to InterPro
        mapping curated by Nicky Mulder at EBI.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Each Pfam-A family now includes two HMMs, one in ls mode
        (global) and another in fs mode (local). The HMMs are available
        on the FTP site in the Pfam_ls and Pfam_fs flatfiles. The old
        flatfiles called Pfam and PfamFrag have now been depracated.
        Each family now contains family specific thresholds for each of
        the ls and fs models. These are stored in the GA (gathering
        threshold) field. The Pfam full alignments are a composed of
        matches from searches with both the ls and fs HMMs.

    <h3>Release 1.6 (19th August 2008)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved &quot;jump to&quot; search</strong>: 
        now returns an error message if the search can&#39;t guess the entry 
        that the user wants, rather than failing silently as previously
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Better validation of FASTA sequences</strong>:
        further improvements to the parsing and validation of sequences in the
        batch search upload form
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grouping of sequence search hits</strong>:
        results of a single sequence search are now grouped into 
        &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;insignificant&quot; hits
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added a RESTful interface</strong>:
        you can now access family and protein sequence information 
        programmatically via a &quot;RESTful&quot; interface. Single sequence 
        searches can also be submitted using the interface, and results 
        retrieved as an XML document. This will replace the SOAP-based interface 
        shortly. See the help pages for more information 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added HMM logos</strong>:
        <a class="ext" href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/logomat-m/help.shtml">
          HMM logos</a> are now shown for all Pfam-A families 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Now using javascript files from third-party servers</strong>:
        we are now loading javascript libraries from high-availability servers
        run by Yahoo! and google. Please check the help pages for the privacy 
        implications of this change
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed species tree alignments</strong>:
        the generation of sequence alignments from checked nodes in the species
        tree should now work correctly
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added link to Proteopedia</strong>:
         <a class="ext" href="http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">
           Proteopedia</a>is a collaborative encyclopedia of three-dimensional 
        structures
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added link to MyHits</strong>:
         <a class="ext" href="http://myhits.vital-it.ch/">MyHits</a> is a set
         of tools for analysing multiple sequence alignments
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pfam-Bs built using ADDA</strong>:
        we now use the <a href="http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/sqgraph/pairsdb/index_html"
         class="ext">ADDA</a> database as the basis for building Pfam-B families
       </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pfam SQL database documentation</strong>:
        the help pages now include database documentation, including table
        descriptions and example queries
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Phylogenetic trees calculated using NJ-method</strong>:
        where possible, phylogenetic trees are now calculated using the 
        neighbour-joining method, where previously we used UPGMA
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added Pfam predicted active sites</strong>:
        single-sequence search results now show any active sites that were
        predicted for the search sequence
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved batch search output:</strong>
        the email with batch search results now includes the job ID and other
        information to help you identify the search
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Release 1.4 (7th January 2008)</h3>  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved sequence validation:</strong>
        the sequence search tool now accepts the commonly seen FASTA header
        styles
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New help section on privacy:</strong>
        we now have a brief overview of the privacy issues surrounding use
        of the Pfam website.          
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New features notification:</strong>
        the index page includes a section listing those features that have
        been added to the site since your last visit.          
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tooltips on domain graphics:</strong>
        as you move your mouse over domain graphics you should now see small
        tooltips which give details of the domain under the cursor, as in the
        old Pfam website.          
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Links underlined:</strong>
        all links should now be underlined, either permananently, or when you 
        move your mouse over them.          
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change status:</strong>
        the page for a Pfam-A family now shows whether the family has changed
        since the previous Pfam release.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sequence search defaults changed:</strong>
        the defaults for the Pfam sequence search in the homepage have been
        changed, so that the search now produces results from both
        &quot;ls&quot; and &quot;fs&quot; models, merged according to the rules
        for each family.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Molecular surfaces in AstexViewer:</strong>
        when you view a protein structure using AstexViewer, you will now see
        the Pfam-A regions outlined with a semi-transparent molecular surface.          
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New species tree tools:</strong>
        you can now download sequences (in FASTA format) or sequence accessions 
        for selected nodes in a species tree.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed sequence display:</strong>
        the page for a protein sequence now shows the correct sequence for the
        entry. Previously duplicated the first residue in the sequence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed URL for XML schema in help pages:</strong>
        uploaded XML files describing domain graphics are validated against an
        XML schema. In the example XML snippets in the domain graphics help 
        page, the URL for that document was wrong. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed a bug in sequence search output:</strong>
        there was a bug in the output of batch sequence searches, causing 
        occasional missing residues in the output. This has been corrected.  
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Release 1.2 (15th October 2007)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Taxonomy searches have been reinstated:</strong>
        you can now search for families that are found in a particular set of
        species, or families that are unique to a given species or taxonomic
        level.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Performance and stability improvements in IE:</strong>
        there have been problems with the interactive species tree in 
        Internet Explorer. We now show a text representation of the species
        tree for IE, with the option to load the interactive tree on demand.
        These changes will hopefully improve the performance of the pages that
        include a species tree and should reduce the number of crashes in
        IE with larger families.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Metaseq data are now available:</strong>
        we have added summary pages for metaseq data and you can now visit a 
        particular entry by putting the ID or accession in the 
        &quot;view a sequence&quot; field on the homepage or via the 
        &quot;jump to&quot; box.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Find sequences using NCBI &quot;GI&quot; number:</strong>
        we have added summary pages for sequences with an NCBI &quot;GI&quot;
        number and, as for metaseq pages, you can visit them from the homepage
        or the &quot;jump to&quot; box.
      </li>
