    <h3>Changes between Pfam 28 and 29</h3>
    <p>Release 29.0 contains a total of 16295 families, with 78 new
    families and 12 families killed since the last release. 73.5% of
    all proteins in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam
    domain.  47.0% of all residues in the sequence database fall within
    Pfam domains.</p>

    <p>Pfam 29.0 is the first release to be based on UniProtKB reference
    proteomes. Previous Pfam releases were based on UniProtKB. Although
    Pfam has moved to using the reference proteome, the Pfam website
    still provides access to Pfam data for UniProtKB. We provide a new
    flatfile called Pfam-A.full.uniprot which contain matches from the
    UniProtKB database and individual full alignments for each entry can
    be obtained from the alignment section. The vavles reported for each
    entry (e.g. species, sequences) on the website, correspond to the
    number found based on searching the reference proteomes. 
    The PDB mappings to Pfam are still based on UniProtKB 
    matches to each Pfam family.</p>

    <h3>Changes between Pfam release 27 and 28</h3>
    <p>Release 28.0 contains a total of 16,230 families, with 1,445 new
    families and 46 families killed since the last release. 81.49% of
    all proteins in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam
    domain.  61.36% of all residues in the sequence database fall within
    Pfam domains. Pfam 28.0 is based on UniProt release 2014_07. 
    </p>


    <h3>Data and Format Changes</h3>
    <p>Since the last release, virtually every <em>seed</em> alignment has been
    revisited and altered such that all of the sequences come from UniProt
    <a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/reference_proteome">reference proteomes</a>.
    This can subtly alter the specificity of some families, but we believe that most
    are as good, if not better, than in the previous form. For the remaining (few) hundreds
    of seed alignments not currently on reference proteomes, we expect these to be updated by
    the release of Pfam 29.0.</p>

    <p>This release also see the demise of Pfam-B. It is no longer feasible to calculate
    the underlying sequence clusters and we believe that it is far more effective to 
    investigate regions not currently covered by Pfam by using the <a class="ext" 
    href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer">HMMER site</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        There have been no major format changes since the last release. We
        have now started to include 
        <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> 
        links in for some of our families so that the annotation for these 
        families can be edited by the community. This is work is still in 
        progress, so not all families have links. In the flatfiles, a 
        wikipedia cross reference is indicated by a line prefixed with WK.

      <p>
        Pfam is now made available under the &#39;No Copyright&#39; licence

      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first release of Pfam using the 
        <a class="ext" href="http://hmmer.janelia.org">HMMER3</a> software. 
        Please note that our HMM library only contains one set of models 
        (Pfam_ls and Pfam_fs has been replaced with Pfam-A.hmm). We have also 
        added an additional new HMM library for the top 20,000 Pfam-Bs 
        (Pfam-B.hmm), which can be used to search for Pfam-B matches.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 21 and 22</h3>
      <p>
        This is the new Pfam website, running on Pfam release 22.0. 
        Release 22.0 contains a total of 9318 families, with 380 new
        families and 19 families killed since the latest release. 73.23% of
        all proteins in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam
        domain. 50.79% of all residues in the sequence database fall within
        Pfam domains. Pfam 22.0 is based on UniProt release 9.7, a
        composite of Swiss-Prot release 51.7 and TrEMBL release 34.7. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The only change in this release is that Phobius has been used to
        calculate both signal peptides and transmembrane regions, instead of 
        signalp and tmhmm.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 20 and 21</h3>

      <p>
        Release 21.0 contains a total of 8957 families, with 669 new families 
        and 8 families killed since the latest release. 73.92% of all proteins 
        in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam domain. 51.48% of all 
        residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pfam now contains the UniProt versions for each sequence in the format 
        of accession.version as used by UniProt. This should allow users to 
        perform a complete audit between release.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also a number of additional tables in the RDB. Many of these 
        have been introduced as part of the overhaul of the database that has
        been performed in preparation for the new Pfam website (UK). Some of 
        these new tables will replace some of the existing tables in the next 
        release.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also removed solvent accessibility from the alignments as the 
        consensus lines produced were often misleading when combining 
        information from different structures. For example, a dimer versus 
        a monomer.

      <p>
        Release 20.0 contains a total of 8296 families, with 123 new
        families and 10 families deleted since the last release. 73.88% of
        all proteins in Pfamseq contain a match to at least one Pfam
        domain. 51.57% of all residues in the sequence database fall
        within Pfam domains.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 18 and 19</h3>
  
      <p>
        Pfam 19.0 is based on UniProt 6.1 (a composite of SWISSPROT
        release 48.1 and SP-TrEMBL release 31.1). This composite
        database is called Pfamseq 19. Pfamseq 19 is available on the
        FTP site. Pfam 19.0 contains a total of 8183 entries, with 223
        new entries since the last release. 73.70% of all proteins in
        pfamseq 19 contain a match to at least one Pfam entry. 51.16% of
        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.
      </p>

      <h3>Format Change</h3>
  
      <p>
         The active site markup in Pfam has changed. The feature name AS
         is now reserved for active sites that are not annotated in the
         Swiss-Prot feature table as being probable, potential or by
         similarity.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Pfam predicts a residue to be an active site residue if it
        aligns in a Pfam alignment with a Swiss-Prot annotated active
        site, and is of the same amino acid type. Active sites which
        are predicted by Pfam are given the feature name pAS.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Active site residues which are annotated in Swiss-Prot as being
        probable, potential or by similarity are marked as predicted
        active sites, as long as they do no overlap with a Pfam
        predicted active site. Active sites which are annotated as
        probable, potential or by similarity by Swiss-Prot are given the
        feature name sAS.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In all cases, active sites are marked with an asterix. Below is
        an example:
      </p>   
      <pre>
      #=GR ODP2_AZOVI/418-637 AS        ...........*..............
      #=GR Q5KEQ8_CRYNE/111-270 pAS     ...........*..............
      #=GR YN14_YEAST/124-327 sAS       ........*.................

      <p>
        Pfam 18.0 is based on UniProt 5.0 (a composite of SWISSPROT
        release 47.0 and SP-TrEMBL release 30.0). This composite
        database is called Pfamseq 18. Pfamseq 18 is available on the
        FTP site. Pfam 18.0 contains a total of 7973 entries, with 130
        new entries since the last release. 75.28% of all proteins in
        pfamseq 18 contain a match to at least one Pfam entry. 53.14% of
        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Format Change</h3>
    
      <p>
        In previous versions of Pfam, nested domains in alignments were
        masked out by &quot;X&quot;s. This masking has been removed in
        version 18.0.
      </p>

        Pfam 17.0 is based on UniProt 4.0 (a composite of SWISSPROT
        release 46.0 and SP-TrEMBL release 29.0). This composite
        database is called Pfamseq 17. Pfamseq 17 is available on the
        FTP site. Pfam 17.0 contains a total of 7868 entries, with 225
        new entries since the last release. 75.24% of all proteins in
        Pfamseq 17 contain a match to at least one Pfam entry. 53.3% of
        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.
      </p>
    
        <h3>New clans</h3>
    
      <p>
        Since the last release, we have added over 70 new clans -
        groupings of related families. To coincide with this we have
        revised our clan pages. Each clan page now additionally contains
        links to a clan membership relationship diagram and an alignment
        of the clan members SEED alignments.
      </p>
    
      <h3>New graphical views</h3>
    
      <p>
        After initial deployment and testing of this release we will
        switch over to our new graphical domain images. A preview can be
        seen on our home page. More details will follow the switch
        over.

        Pfam 13.0 is based on UniProt 1.4 (a composite of SWISSPROT
        release 42.12 and SP-TrEMBL release 25.12). This composite
        database is called Pfamseq 13. Pfamseq 13 is available on the

      </p>
    
      <h3>iPfam</h3>
    
      <p>
        Released during the last release, a new resource called iPfam
        was made available. iPfam contains infromation about known
        domain-domain interactions at the residue and atom levels.
        There are loads of new and exciting features in this new section
        on the website, which are described further in the iPfam
        section. The underlying relational database files are available
        on the FTP site.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Clans</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam release 13 sees the introduction of Clans. Clans are
        groupings of Pfam families that we believe have arisen from a
        single evolutionary origin. Evidence of their evolutionary
        relationship comes from their similar tertiary structures, or
        when structures are not available, by common sequence motifs. As
        the members within a clan are allowed to overlap, the families
        within a clan are allowed to compete for domain hits. Hence, it
        is possible to obtain multiple significant hits to more than one
        of the families within the clan.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Versions in the HMMs</h3>
    
      <p>
        In the flatfiles and when HMMs are downloads, Pfam families now
        have a version number after the accession number. The version
        number is incremented when the HMM changes. This feature is of
        particular use for genome annotation such that only changed
        models need to be researched against the genome. The version
        numbers are obsolete for the website.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 9 and 10</h3>
    
      <h3>Alignment mode</h3>
    
      <p>
        The previous major release, Pfam 7.0, introduced full alignments
        that were composed of matches from searches with both the ls and
        fs HMMs. In the majority of cases full length global matches
        (i.e. sequence matches to the ls HMM) are taken first, followed
        by the fragment matches. However, in some cases, one of two
        other options are used; the matches can be ordered by score or
        partial matches are taken before global matches. The AM line in
        the build lines section has been introduced in this release to
        inform the user which alignment method was used to build the
        full alignment.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Context Domains</h3>
    
      <p>
        This release of Pfam also includes the full implementation of
        Context Domains. Context domains are matches to a Pfam HMM that
        score below the gathering threshold, but based on the similarity
        of the domain architecture to other sequences has been marked up
        as likely matches. More information is available.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Nested Domains</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam 8.0 also allows some overlaps between families when one
        domain is nested within another. Such overlaps are tightly
        controlled and are only allowed when it is biologically
        correct. The overlapping family is indicated by the NE line and
        the NL indicates the location of the nested domain. More
        information is available.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Alignment mark up</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam alignments are now supplied with the consensus sequence for
        the alignment. In all cases a threshold of 60% is used (i.e. 60%
        or above of the amino acids in this column belong to this class
        of residue). The program used was based on the Consensus program
        by Nigel Brown at EMBL.

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 7 and 8</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam 8.0 is based in a composite of SWISSPROT release 40.31 and
        SP-TrEMBL release 22. This composite database is called Pfamseq
        8. Pfamseq 8 is available on the FTP site. Pfam 8.0 contains a
        total of 5193 entries, with 160 new entries and 16 entries
        deleted since the last release. 73.6% of all proteins in
        Pfamseq 8 contain a match to at least one Pfam entry. 53.0% of
        all residues in the sequence database fall within Pfam entries.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Alignment mode</h3>

      <h3>Changes between Pfam releases 6 and 7</h3>
    
      <p>
        Pfam 7.0 is based on a composite of SWISSPROT release 40 and
        SP-TrEMBL release 18. This composite database is called Pfamseq
        7. Pfamseq 7 is available on the FTP site.Pfam 7.0 contains a
        total of 3360 families, with 320 new families and 33 families
        being deleted.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Links to the HOMSTRAD and SYSTERS database have been added. GO
        terms for each family have been derived from the GO to InterPro
        mapping curated by Nicky Mulder at EBI.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Each Pfam-A family now includes two HMMs, one in ls mode
        (global) and another in fs mode (local). The HMMs are available
        on the FTP site in the Pfam_ls and Pfam_fs flatfiles. The old
        flatfiles called Pfam and PfamFrag have now been depracated.
        Each family now contains family specific thresholds for each of
        the ls and fs models. These are stored in the GA (gathering
        threshold) field. The Pfam full alignments are a composed of
        matches from searches with both the ls and fs HMMs.

    <h3>Release 4.0 (29th April 2014)</h3>
    <p>
      This change coincided with the move from Sanger to EBI. There were no
      major changes to the website, though the underlying search system was
      entirely re-written to use the EBI external services web framework.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>Remove references to mirrors</strong> Pfam is now served

       <strong>Selections in sunbursts species trees:</strong> sunbursts now
       support selections and the generation of an alignment and FASTA files
       from a selection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DNA searches:</strong> the DNA search system has been entirely
        re-written and now uses a six-frame translation to generate protein
        sequences, which are then searched using our standard pfam_scan.pl
        script. Results are shown in an interactive page, as for protein
        sequences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Family page alignment tab</strong>: the alignment tab has been
        redesigned to make it easier to navigate the wider range of available
        alignment types (now including those generated from representative
        proteomes) and display options.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scores in protein summary</strong>: the protein page now
        includes E-values and bit scores in the summary table beneath the

    <h3>Release 3.0 (31st March 2011)</h3>
    <p>Major changes to the site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many family pages now contain content from Wikipedia. Annotations from
        Wikipedia, Pfam and InterPro are now shown in separate sections within
        the &#39;Summary&#39; tab (where appropriate). When a Wikipedia article
        has been associated with a family, we provide a link to the orginal
        content in Wikipedia so that it can be edited. Updated content
        will appear in Pfam within a day or so. We are keen for annotations
        to be added via this mechanism as it reduces the burden on our
        curators and the annotations will be made available to Pfam users much
        more quickly than waiting for the next release of the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have a new representation of the species distribution, called
        <strong>sunburst</strong>. Rather than showing the species as a tree,
        this uses a radial layout to indicate the species. The sunburst is
        colour coded according to the taxonomic distribution, thereby allowing
        rapid assessment of the taxonomic diversity found within the family.
        We have implemented this view because many species trees are very
        large and are slow to display. The old tree view is still available
        in an adjacent tab.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other minor changes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All of the help pages, previously tagged as being potentially
        inaccurate, have been updated to reflect the changes imposed by the
        transition to HMMER3.
      </li>
      <li>
        Structure pages now include 
        <a class="ext" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-apps/widgets/pdbprints">
          PDBprints</a>, which are small icons that are designed to convey
        important information about the entry.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tool for generating your own domain graphics have been replaced
        with a similar tool, which uses the same JavaScript and HTML5 canavas
        element as is used on the site.

        the page for a protein sequence now shows the correct sequence for the
        entry. Previously duplicated the first residue in the sequence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed URL for XML schema in help pages:</strong>
        uploaded XML files describing domain graphics are validated against an
        XML schema. In the example XML snippets in the domain graphics help 
        page, the URL for that document was wrong. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed a bug in sequence search output:</strong>
        there was a bug in the output of batch sequence searches, causing 
        occasional missing residues in the output. This has been corrected.  
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Taxonomy searches have been reinstated:</strong>
        you can now search for families that are found in a particular set of
        species, or families that are unique to a given species or taxonomic
        level.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Performance and stability improvements in IE:</strong>
        there have been problems with the interactive species tree in 
        Internet Explorer. We now show a text representation of the species
        tree for IE, with the option to load the interactive tree on demand.
        These changes will hopefully improve the performance of the pages that
        include a species tree and should reduce the number of crashes in
        IE with larger families.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Metaseq data are now available:</strong>
        we have added summary pages for metaseq data and you can now visit a 
        particular entry by putting the ID or accession in the 
        &quot;view a sequence&quot; field on the homepage or via the 
        &quot;jump to&quot; box.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Find sequences using NCBI &quot;GI&quot; number:</strong>
        we have added summary pages for sequences with an NCBI &quot;GI&quot;
        number and, as for metaseq pages, you can visit them from the homepage
        or the &quot;jump to&quot; box.
