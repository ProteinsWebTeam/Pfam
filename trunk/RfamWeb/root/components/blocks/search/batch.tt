      Upload a FASTA-format file containing multiple nucleotide sequences to
      be searched for matching Rfam families. Results of the search will be
      returned to you at the email address that you specify. Please check the
      notes below for the restrictions on uploaded sequence files.

    <div id="batchNotes" style="display: none">

      <h2>File contents</h2>

      <p>
        We accept only nucleotide sequences and your uploaded file must conform
        to a fairly strict interpretation of the FASTA file format. We apply the
        following checks to the format of uploaded sequence files. Files that do
        not conform to the following rules will be rejected by the server.
      </p>

      <h3>File contents</h3>

      <p>
        Files must contain only header lines and sequence lines. Header lines,
        which begin with &quot;>&quot;, can be used to describe the sequence that
        follows. There is no fixed format for header lines but we restrict the
        characters that are allowed. If your header lines contain any of the following characters, your file will be rejected:
      </p>
      <strong><code>; \ ! *</code></strong>
      <p>
        Note that we explicitly include the semi-colon (;) in the list of
        forbidden characters, although this may be used to denote comments in
        some versions of the FASTA-format. Please do not use comments in the
        FASTA files that you upload here.
      </p>

      <h3>Header rows</h3>

      <p>
        The FASTA-format specification recommends that header lines are kept
        shorter than 80 characters. Note that, although we do not restrict the
        length of header lines, the output that you will receive only shows the
        first 20 characters of each header line. You should therefore ensure that
        the sequence is identifiable using only the first twenty characters of
        its header.
      </p>

      <h3>Sequence symbols</h3>
      <p>
        Your sequence should be a valid nucleotide sequence. As such, the
        sequence line should contain only valid IUPAC nucleotide symbols,
        i.e. the characters A,C,G,U,T,R,Y,S,W,M,K,B,D,H,V and N, in either
        upper and/or lower case. In the context of a Rfam search, gaps and
        translation stops have little meaning and should not be used.
        <strong>We no longer accept gap characters</strong> such as
        &quot;-&quot; or &quot;*&quot;.
      </p>

      <h2>Service limits</h2>

      <p>
        Searches run on a &quot;compute farm&quot; with a limited number of
        &quot;slots&quot;. Each search takes one slot and once all slots are in
        use, new jobs wait in a queue for the next slot to become free. In
        order to prevent large jobs occupying slots for very long periods,
        which can impact the availability of the system for other users, we
        place a number of restrictions on the size of job that we will accept.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are planning to submit a lot of sequence searches, we recommend
        installing
        <a href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/tools/rfam_scan.pl">rfam_scan.pl</a>
        locally.
      </p>

      <h3>File size</h3>

      <p>
        Files must have fewer than 100,000 lines and fewer than 1000 sequences.
      </p>

      <h3>Sequence length</h3>

      <p>
        Each sequence must be no longer than 200,000 nucleotides.
      </p>
