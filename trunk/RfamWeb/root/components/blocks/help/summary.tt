      The Rfam database is a collection of RNA sequence families of
      structural RNAs including non-coding RNA genes as well as
      cis-regulatory elements. Each family is represented by multiple
      sequence alignments and covariance models (CMs).  You can use the Rfam
      website to obtain information about an individual family, or browse
      our families and genome annotations. Alternatively you can download
      all of the Rfam data from our <a class="ext"

    <h2><a name="nuts">Nuts &amp; Bolts - how we build our families</a></h2>

    <h3>Rfamseq database</h3>
    
    <p> 
      The underlying nucleotide sequence database from which we build our
      families (known as rfamseq) is derived from the <a
      href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/">EMBL nucleotide database</a>.  We
      include EMBL Standard (STD) and Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) data
      classes. This includes all the environmental sample sequences (ENV)
      but we currently exclude the patented (PAT) and synthetic (SYN)
      divisions.  You should note that rfamseq does NOT include Expressed
      Sequence Tag (EST) or Genome Survey Sequence (GSS) data classes.
    </p>
    <p>    
      Rfamseq is usually updated with each major Rfam release, e.g., 8.0, 9.0. 
      You can find out the the EMBL version currently in use in the
      release README file on our <a class="ext"
      href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/CURRENT">ftp site</a>.     
    </p>
  
    <h3>Seed alignments and secondary structure annotation</h3> 

    <p>
      Our seed alignments are small, curated sets of representative sequences
      for each family, as opposed to an alignment of all known members. The
      seed alignment also has as a secondary structure annotation, which
      represents the conserved secondary structure for these sequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ideal basis for a new family is an RNA element that has some
      known functional classification, is evolutionarily conserved, and has
      evidence for a secondary structure. In order to build a new family, we
      must first obtain at least one experimentally validated example from
      the published literature. If any other homologues are identified in the
      literature, we will add these to the seed. Alternatively, if these are
      not available, we will try to identify others members either by
      similarity searching (using BLAST) or manual curation.
    </p>
    <p>      
      Where possible we will use a multiple sequence alignment and
      secondary structure annotation provided in the literature. If this is
      the case, we will cite the source of both the alignment and the
      secondary structure. You should note that the structure annotations
      obtained from the literature may be experimentally validated or they
      may be RNA folding predictions (commonly <a class="ext"
      href="http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/cgi-bin/rna-form1-2.3.cgi">MFOLD</a>). 
      Unfortunately, we do not discriminate between these two cases when we 
      site the PubMed Identifier (PMID) and you will need to refer to the 
      original publications to clarify.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, where this information is not available from the
      literature, we will generate an alignment and secondary structure
      prediction using various software, such as <a class="ext"
      href="http://genome.ku.dk/resources/war">WAR</a>. This
      software allows us to cherry pick the best alignment and secondary
      structure prediction. Historically, the methods used to
      make these alignments and folding predictions have varied. 
      Author names added to the list indicate that the published or predicted 
      secondary structure has been manually curated in some way. The last 
      author on the list will be the most recent editor of the secondary 
      structure. You can
      find the method we have used for the seed alignment or the secondary
      structure annotation in the <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>SS</strong> 
      lines of the Stockholm format or in the curation information pages.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Covariance Models</h3>

    <p>
      From the seed alignment, we use the <a class="ext"
      href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">Infernal software</a> to build a
      probabilistic model (covariance model or CM) for this family. Useful
      references on stochastic free grammars and covariance models can be
      found in the <span class="link"
      onclick="switchTab('helpReferencesBlock');">citing Rfam</span>
      section. This model is then used to search the rfamseq
      database for other possible homologs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Searching a nucleotide database as larger as rfamseq with a covariance
      model is hugely computationally expensive. In order to do this in
      reasonable time, we use sequence based filters to prune the search
      space prior to applying the CMs. Please refer to the recent Rfam 
      publication for more details on how we implement this.
    </p>

    <h3>Expanding the seed (iteration)</h3>

    <p>
      If the CM search of rfamseq identifies any homologs that we believe
      would improve the seed, we use the Infernal software (cmalign) to
      add these sequences to the seed alignment. From the new seed, the CM
      is re-built and re-searched against rfamseq. We refer to this process
      of expanding the seed using Infernal searching as "iteration". We
      continue to iterate the seed until we have good resolution
      between real and false hits and cannot improve the seed membership
      further.
    </p>

    <h3>Important points to remember about our seed alignments</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>We can only build families using the sequences in rfamseq</li> 
      <li>We can only build a family where we can identify more than one 
        sequence in rfamseq</li>
      <li>Sequences in the seed cannot be manually altered in any way, 
        e.g. no manual excision of introns, no editing of sequencing errors, 
        no marking up modified nucleotides etc</li>
      <li>At least one sequence in the seed will have some experimental 
        evidence of transcription, e.g. northern blot or RT-PCR, and, 
        preferably, some evidence of function</li>
      <li>The secondary structure should ideally have some experimental 
        support (such as structure probing, NMR or crystallography)
        and/or evidence of evolutionary conservation. We do, however, use and 
        generate predicted structures</li>
      <li>Each seed sequence will be a significant match to the corresponding
        covariance model. A significant score is generally greater than 20 
        bits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rfam full alignments</h3>

    <p>
      The Rfam full alignments contain all of the sequences in rfamseq that 
      we can identify as members of the family. The alignment is generated by 
      searching the covariance model for the family against the rfamseq 
      database. Matches that score above a curated threshold are aligned to 
      the CM to produce the full alignment. All sequences in the seed will 
      also be present in the full  alignment. You should read the 
      <span class="link" onclick="switchTab('helpCurationBlock');">curation 
      information</span> pages for details of bit scores and gathering 
      thresholds.    
    </p>

    <h3>Family annotation</h3>

    <p>
      In order to provide some background and functional information about
      a family, we link to a <a class="ext" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">
        Wikipedia</a> page that provides relevant background information on 
      the family. We have either linked to an existing page or we have created 
      the page ourselves in Wikipedia. As this annotation is hosted by 
      Wikipedia, you are free to edit, correct and otherwise improve
      this annotation and we would encourage you to do so.
    </p>

    <h3>Phylogenetic trees</h3>

    <h4>Fewer than 64 sequences</h4>

    <p>
      It order to save computational resources, we compute accurate maximum
      likelihood trees only for alignments containing fewer than 64
      sequences. For this we use <a class="ext"
        href="http://selab.janelia.org/software.html">ERATE</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>More than 64 sequences</h4>
    
    <p>
      For alignments containing more than 64 sequences, we use the
      neighbour-joining method implemented in <a class="ext"
        href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html">
          PHYLIP</a> with default parameters. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>More than 1024 sequences</h4>
    
    <p>
      Alignments containing more than 1024 sequences are filtered based 
      upon sequence identity, i.e. one member of a pair of highly similar
      sequences is removed from the alignment, this operation is performed
      iteratively for the entire alignment for a gradually decreasing
      identity threshold until the total number of sequences in the
      remaining alignment is less than 1024. The tree is then generated from
      this remaining alignment using PHYLIP.
