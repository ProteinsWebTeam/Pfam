    <h2>Annotating non-coding RNAs in complete genomes</h2>

    <p>
      Before trying to annotate your own genome sequences on your local
      hardware or submitting lots of sequences to Rfam via the website, please 
      check that the following resources do not provide the annotation for you:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><a class="ext" href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a></li>
      <li><a class="ext" href="http://ensemblgenomes.org/">Ensembl Genomes</a></li>      
      <li><a class="ext" href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genome Browser</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Rfam library of covariance models can be used to search sequences
      (including whole genomes) for homologues to known non-coding RNAs, in
      conjunction with the <a class="ext" 
        href="http://eddylab.org/infernal/">Infernal</a> software.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Compute</h3>

    <p>
      Covariance model searches are extremely computionally intensive. A small
      model (like "tRNA") can search a sequence database at a rate of around
      300 bases/sec. The compute time scales roughly to the 4th power of the
      length of the RNA, so searching larger models quickly become infeasible 
      without significant compute resources. 
    </p>

    <h3>2. Specificity</h3>

    <p>
      The Rfam/Infernal approach aims to be sufficiently generic to cope with 
      all types of RNAs. A sequence can be searched using every model in 
      exactly the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, several tools are available that search for specific types of
      RNA, such as <a class="ext"
      href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/">tRNAscan-SE</a> for tRNAs,
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/RNAmmer/">RNAMMER</a> 
      for rRNA, <a class="ext" href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/snoscan/">
        snoscan</a> for snoRNAs, and <a class="ext" 
        href="http://bio.lundberg.gu.se/srpscan/">SRPscan</a> for
      SRP RNA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The generic Rfam approach has obvious advantages for the user. However, 
      the specialised programs are likely to incorporate heuristics and 
      family-specific information, which ensure that they out-perform the 
      general method, often requiring only a fraction of the compute time.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Pseudogenes</h3>

    <p>
      ncRNA derived pseudogenes pose the biggest problem for eukaryotic
      genome annotation using Rfam/Infernal. Many genomes contain repeat
      elements that are derived from a non-coding RNA gene, sometimes in
      huge copy number. For example, Alu repeats in human are evolutionarily
      related to SRP RNA, and the active B2 SINE in mouse is recently
      derived from a tRNA. In addition, specific RNA genes appear to have
      undergone massive pseudogene expansions in certain genomes. For
      example, searching the human genome using the Rfam U6 family yields
      over 1000 hits, all with very high score. These are not "false
      positives" in the sequence analysis sense, because they are closely 
      related by sequence to the real U6 genes, but they completely
      overwhelm the small number (only 10s) of expected real U6 genes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      At present we don't have computational methods to distinguish the real
      genes from the pseudogenes (of course the standard protein coding gene
      tricks - in frame stop codons and the like - are useless). The sensible 
      and precedented method for ncRNA annotation in large vertebrate genomes 
      is to annotate the easy-to-identify RNAs, such as tRNAs
      and rRNAs, and then trust only hits with very high sequence identity
      (&gt; 95% over &gt; 95% of the sequence length) to an experimentally
      verified real gene. <a class="ext"
        href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/">tRNAscan-SE</a> has a 
        very nice method for detecting tRNA pseudogenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend that you use Rfam/Infernal for vertebrate genome 
      annotation with <strong>extreme caution</strong>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said all this, Rfam/Infernal does tell us about important
      sequence similarities that are effectively undetectable by other means.
      However, in complex eukaryotic genomes, it is important to treat hits as
      sequence similarity information (much as you might treat BLAST hits),
      rather than as evidence of bona fide ncRNA genes.
