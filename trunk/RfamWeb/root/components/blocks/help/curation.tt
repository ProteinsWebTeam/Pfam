      For each family we provide a curation information page. This is where 
      you can download the covariance model for this family and also browse 
      the details of the family building process. The majority of this 
      information is also available in the Stockholm format flat files 
      (<strong>Rfam.seed</strong> and <strong>Rfam.full</strong>) that are 
      available from our <a class="ext" 
        href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam">ftp site</a>.

    <h2>Curation</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Seed source:</strong> miRBase; Wilkinson A</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>SE</strong> line in the Stockholm files. 
        This will credit the original source of the sequences that were used 
        to build the family. This will usually be a a published article, a 
        database or the manual curator. See the <span class="link" 
        onclick="switchTab('helpSummaryBlock');">help summary page</span> for 
        for an explanation on how we build our SEED alignments.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Type:</strong> Gene;miRNA;</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>TP</strong> line in the Stockholm files. 
        A simple functional classification of our families. This is our own 
        ontology and does not current directly relate to the ontologies used 
        by other databases. For a full list of our current ontologies see the
        help section on
        <span class="link" onclick="switchTab('helpgetStartedBlock');">
          searching by type</span>.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Author:</strong> Wilkinson A</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>AU</strong> line in the Stockholm files. This 
        will credit the curators who have had input in building or modifying 
        this family. The order of the names in this line are chronological 
        (new authors are added to the end of the list).
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Number in seed:</strong> 3</dt>
      <dd>
        The number of sequence regions in the seed alignment
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Number in full:</strong> 11</dt>
      <dd>
        The number of sequence regions in the FULL alignment
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Build commands</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Build command:</strong> cmbuild CM SEED</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>BM</strong> line in the Stockholm files. This 
        explains the options used to to build the covariance model. This usually 
        just indicates that the model (CM) was built using the seed alignment.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Search command:</strong> cmsearch --toponly CM SEQDB</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>BM</strong> line in the Stockholm files. This 
        details the options that were used for searching the CM against the
        rfamseq database. By default we use the "glocal" option (global 
        alignment with respect to the model, local with respect to the 
        sequence). This requires that the entire model matches a sub-sequence 
        of the target sequence. This mode tends to exclude fragment matches. 
        However, you will note that some models are searched with the local 
        alignment option (allowing matches to fragments of the model). You 
        should consult the <a class="ext" href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">
          Infernal</a> user guide for a fuller explanation of these different 
        search modes.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Gathering cutoff:</strong> 25.0</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>GA</strong> line in the Stockholm files. This 
        indicates the bit score gathering threshold set by our curators when 
        building the family. All database hits that score at or above this 
        threshold will be included in the full alignment. This is the bit score 
        threshold that we recommend you use when gathering large 
        scale, automated data annotations. However, you should consult the 
        <a class="ext" href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">
          Infernal</a> user guide for more detailed information on 
        covariance models and the significance of bit scores.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Trusted cutoff:</strong> 26.1</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>TC</strong> line in the Stockholm files. This 
        indicates the scores of the lowest-scoring hit that were included as 
        true members of the Rfam family. Hits that score above this are all 
        expected to be members of the family.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Noise cutoff:</strong> 23.1</dt>
      <dd>
        Equivalent to the <strong>NC</strong> line in the Stockholm files. The 
        score of the highest scoring hit that were not included as true members 
        of the Rfam family because they are considered to be at the top of the 
        noise (false hits). A good model will give good discrimination between 
        the TC values and the NC values. You should consult the 
        <a class="ext" href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">
          Infernal</a> user guide for more information on covariance models 
        and bit scores.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Covariance model</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A link to download the covariance model for this family. If you want 
        to download multiple CMs, you can obtain a tar file containing all 
        of the CMs for an Rfam release the <a class="ext" 
        href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam">ftp site</a> 
        (Rfam.tar.gz).
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Distributions of bit scores</h2>

    <p>
      These images are not available in the flatfile release and are provided 
      in the website to allow the users a quick visual guide to the range of 
      scores we obtained when searching the model against rfamseq. Our curators 
      use this distribution when curating the gathering cutoff value for the 
      family. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper panel shows the score distribution for all of the hits to the 
      covariance model. The hits are coloured blue if the hit overlaps a seed 
      sequence, otherwise they are in red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower panel shows score distributions for those sequences where the 
      associated descriptions match family terms, such as "mir-422", or 
      forbidden terms, such as "repeat", "repetitive", "pseudogene" and 
      "transpos", shown in light blue and pink respectively. Note that 
      sequences that match both are counted twice here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truncated distributions are useful when the number of low scoring 
      hits is several orders of magnitude more than the high scoring hits. 
      The x-axis is truncated at the left side of the distribution, thereby 
      removing the bulk of the low scoring hits.
