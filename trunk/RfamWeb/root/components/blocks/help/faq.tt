    <h3><a name="seedandfull">What are "seed" and "full" alignments?</a></h3>

    <p> 
      Each family in Rfam has two multiple sequence alignments. The
      "seed" alignment is a hand-curated alignment of known members of the
      family. This alignment may not contain all known members of a family,
      but rather a representative set. We use the <a class="ext"
        href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">Infernal</a> software to build a
      covariance model from this alignment. We then use the covariance model
      to search the rfamseq sequence database for other family members and to
      automatically align all detected homologues to the model, to generate
      the "full" alignment.
    </p>

    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>

    <h3><a name="scores">What do the scores for hits to Rfam models mean?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      When you search a sequence against Rfam and obtain a hit to one
      of our families, we report the start and end coordinates of the matching
      region, the orientation of the match, and the bit score. The bit score
      (also known as the log-odds score ) is generated by the Infernal
      software when it tries to match your sequence to the model. In very
      simple terms, it is a measure of how well your sequence matches the
      model; the higher the bit score, the better your sequences fits the
      model. 
    </p>
    <p class="imageTop">
      More specifically the bit score is the log<sub>2</sub> of the
      probability of the query sequence given the model, over the probability
      of the sequence given the null model:
    </p>
    <img class="formula"
         src="[% c.uri_for( '/static/images/bit_score.png' ) %]"
         alt="bit score = log2 ( Pcm / Pnull )" />
    <p class="imageBottom">
      In theory this means that positive
      bits scores are significant but, in practice, more conservative cutoffs
      are used as the size of the database means we can observe hits with low
      positive bits scores by chance. (See the <a class="ext"
      href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">Infernal user guide</a> for 
      more information.)
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>

    <h3><a name="secondarystructure">Where does your secondary structure 
      annotation come from?</a></h3>

    <p>
      Ideally, when we build a seed the initial secondary structure
      annotation is obtained from the literature. In these cases the
      secondary structure is usually available only for a few of the member
      sequences in the seed. Our aim is to generate models that represent
      conserved secondary structure, so when we begin to expand the
      membership of the seed to be as representative as possible, we will
      only retain the secondary structure annotation that is conserved
      between the majority of sequences. You should also note that the
      annotations obtained from the literature may be experimentally
      validated or they may be RNA folding predictions (commonly <a class="ext"
        href="http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/">MFOLD</a>). We do not 
      discriminate between the two and you will need to refer to the 
      original publications to clarify. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      In those cases where no secondary structure prediction is available in
      the literature, but where we have good set of seed sequences, we 
      frequently use a local installation of the <a class="ext"
      href="http://genome.ku.dk/resources/war">WAR software</a> which allows
      us to cherry pick the best alignment and secondary structure
      prediction from multiple tools. Historically, the folding prediction 
      tools used has varied and the method used will be indicated.
    </p>   
    <p>
      You can find the alignment and structure source for each family in the
      curation tab, or in the SE and SS lines in the Stockholm
      file. Where the source is obtained from the literature, we will provide
      the PubMed identifier (PMID). You should also note that the seed
      alignments often get updated between releases and may be manually
      adjusted by the curator. As a result, attempts to obtain the same
      structure using the same prediction method, may not return exactly the
      same structure as shown on the Rfam SEED alignment. We usually
      indicate where the a structure has been manually edited.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>

    <h3><a name="familydefine">What is your definition of an RNA family?</a></h3>

    <p>
      We will group sequences into a "family" where we can identify sequence
      or secondary structure conservation using our covariation models. This
      is decided when we build our seed alignment and search the CM against
      rfamseq. From the resulting searches we decide where the cutoff
      threshold should be. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When we set this cut off threshold, we are essentially deciding that 
      any sequences that score above the threshold are true, homologous members 
      of the family, whilst those below are "chance hits". This discrimination 
      between true and false is usually very clear if we have a representative 
      seed alignment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, for various biological reasons, it can be extremely 
      difficult to get good resolution between true and false predictions. 
      In such case we make an informed decision on where the cutoff should be.
      As a result, some families may contain false positives (often 
      pseudogenes) or may also lose some true positives below the threshold. 
      In such cases we will have made the best choice we can in order to limit 
      the false positive and loss of true positives. If you have queries about 
      the membership of any of our families, please do 
      <span class="link" onclick="tabPage.switchTab('helpContactUsBlock');">
        contact us</span> and we will try to clarify or resolve the problem.
    </p> 
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>

    <h3><a name="validatedseqs">How can I tell which are predicted and which 
      are experimentally confirmed sequences?</a></h3>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to do this, since
      we do not add a source tag to each individual sequence in either our
      seed or full alignments. All of our families (seed alignments) are
      based on one or more experimentally validated exemplars of the
      family, but the majority of the other member sequences are added by
      homology search and manual curation. We have high confidence in these
      members of the seed alignment that we use to build the covariance model 
      and computationally predict other possible members in the nucleotide 
      database. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can study the descriptions of sequences extracted from the EMBL 
      nucleotide database, occasionally this contains useful information 
      about function.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>

    <h3><a name="myseqmissing">Why is my favourite sequence not in the 
      family?</a></h3>

    <p>
      The most likely reason is that it is not in the EMBL release that rfamseq 
      is based on. With each major release, e.g. 8.0, 9.0, we update the
      underlying nucleotide database. You can check which version we are 
      currently using <a class="ext" 
        href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/CURRENT/README">
          here</a>. If, however, your sequence <em>is</em> in the relevant EMBL 
      release but is still absent from a relevant family, it is possible that 
      our model may need to be improved. Please <span class="link" 
      onclick="tabPage.switchTab('helpContactUsBlock');">contact us</span> with the 
      relevant information and we will decide whether the sequence should 
      indeed be included and, if so, we will try to improve our model. 
    </p>

    <h3><a name="cminfo">Where can I find out more about RNA sequence 
      analysis/covariance models/SCFGs?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      The <a class="ext" href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">Infernal</a> 
      software package, which is an essential companion to the Rfam database,
      now has extensive documentation, along with some description of how 
      covariance models work for RNA sequence analysis. Background and theory 
      can also be found in the excellent book <a class="ext" 
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0521629713">
        Biological Sequence Analysis</a> by Richard Durbin, Sean Eddy, 
      Anders Krogh, and Graeme Mitchison (Cambridge University Press, 1998).

    <!--searching-->

    <h3><a name="familyinfo">How can I find information about a particular 
      RNA family?</a></h3>

    <p>
      You can do this in several ways. If you already know the Rfam
      accession or name of the family, you can use the "jump to" boxes on
      the home page or any tabbed page in the website. Alternatively, if 
      you're not sure of the family accession or correct name and want to 
      try a broad-ranging search, you should use the "keyword" search box 
      in the header of each page. This search allows the use of ambiguous 
      terms and will search multiple sections of the database for a match to 
      your query term. The results page will give you a list of all the 
      families with matches and you can follow the links to the summary page 
      for each family.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're not even sure of your query term and simply want to
      browse our families, click on the "browse" link in the header of
      every page. This takes you to an index that lists all Rfam families 
      according to accession and ID and links directly to the summary page
      for each family.
    </p>
    
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>

    <h3><a name="searchdnaseq">How can I search my DNA sequence for non-coding 
      RNA genes?</a></h3>

    <p> 
      Both our <a href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/search">single sequence</a> 
      and <a href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/search?tab=searchBatchBlock">
        batch</a> searches allow you to search a nucleotide sequences against 
      the Rfam model library. Any hits to Rfam families will be returned with 
      start and end coordinates, orientation and a score for each hit.
    </p>
    <p> 
      For short single sequences, our <a href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/search">
        single sequence</a> search tool will return Rfam matches to your sequence
      interactively. However,  if your sequence is longer than 2Kbp, we suggest 
      that you fragment it into smaller, overlapping segments and use the 
      <a href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/search">batch search</a>
      facility. You might find <a class="ext"
        href="http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/splitter">
        this tool</a> useful for splitting large sequences into fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if you have a very large number of sequences to search, you may
      find it most convenient to download and
      <span class="link" onclick="tabPage.switchTab('helpGenomeAnnotBlock');">
        run Rfam locally</span>.  
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>

    <h3><a name="seqIds">What do the sequence identifiers in your 
      alignments mean?</a></h3>
      
    <p>
      The identifier &quot;<strong>AY033236.1/563-353</strong>&quot; means that 
      the EMBL accession is &quot;AY033236&quot;, the sequence version is 
      &quot;1&quot; (optional), the start coordinate is &quot;563&quot; and the
      end coordinate is &quot;353&quot;, the strand is given by the order of 
      the coordinates, in this case it is negative.
    </p>

    <!--downloading-->

    <h3><a name="downloadalign">How can I view or download a family 
      alignment?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      From the family summary page, go to the "Alignments" tab on the left
      side panel. The alignments tab will give you multiple drop down
      options on how to either view or download the sequences for this
      family, in an aligned or fasta format. The formatting options allow you
      to select which type of format you would prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the alignment is very large the formatting tool may not be
      suitable and you may prefer to use the preformatted alignment in 
      Stockholm format. A number of Stockholm alignment re-formatters and 
      viewers exist, such as the sreformat program from the <a class="ext"
        href="http://hmmer.janelia.org">HMMer package</a> and the <a class="ext"
        href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/sam.griffiths-jones/software/ralee/">
        RALEE</a> major mode for Emacs. You can read more about Stockholm 
      format on <a class="ext"
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format">Wikipedia</a>.
    </p>    
    <p>
      If you are interested retrieving alignments for multiple families, you 
      can download all our seed and full alignments in Stockholm format 
      flat-files from our <a class="ext"
      href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/CURRENT">ftp site</a>.

    <h3><a name="downloadfasta">How can I download a subset of sequences from 
      a family?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this has not been implemented yet. There are plans in 
      place to modify the underlying Rfam database to allow this.

    <h3><a name="downloadfastaspecies">How can I download all Rfam sequences 
      for my favourite species?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this has not been implemented yet. This type of query 
      can potentially return huge amounts of data, enough to scare our 
      our database administrators. There are plans in place to implement a 
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.biomart.org/">Biomart</a> interface 
      that will allow these queries. Meanwhile, if you

    <p>
      The "Taxonomy" tab on the search page will allow you to
      perform taxonomic queries. In fact, this function also allows you to
      search with queries from internal nodes of the NCBI taxonomic
      tree. However, the results are only returned on the family level, not
      the sequence level.

    <h3><a name="submitfamily">I would like to submit a family</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Great! We are very keen for the community to help keep us updated on
      new families. Ideally, a new family for Rfam should contain elements
      (RNA sequences) that have some known functional classification, are
      evolutionarily conserved and have evidence for a secondary structure.
      The families should not solely be based on prediction only, e.g. RNAz,
      EvoFold, or QRNA predictions, nor solely on transcriptomic data, e.g.
      tiling array or deep sequencing. For more detailed information on
      how to submit a family, please read the rest of the Rfam documentation
      but, if you have any queries, please do 
      <span class="link" onclick="tabPage.switchTab('helpContactUsBlock');">
        contact us</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your family is sufficiently interesting, or if you have several of 
      them, you may be interested in publishing your family in the RNA families 
      track that is now available through <a class="ext"

    <h3><a name="editseed">How can I edit a SEED alignment?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      We do not currently provide public access to edit our alignments. 
      This is advantageous in that it maintains our standard of alignments 
      and structures, but, if you feel our seed alignment/structure 
      annotations can and should be improved, please  
      <span class="link" onclick="tabPage.switchTab('helpContactUsBlock');">
        contact us</span>, preferably supplying us with a new alignment, in 
      Stockholm format, and we will do our best to incorporate the improvements.

      family.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Gathering cut off (GA)</h3>
    
    <p>
      The bit score gathering threshold, set by our curators when building
      the family. All sequences that score at or above this threshold will
      be included in the full alignment.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Infernal</h3>
    
    <p>
      <a class="ext" href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">Infernal</a> is the 
      core software that enables us to make consensus RNA secondary structure 
      profiles (covariance models (CMs)) for our families. We also use Infernal
      for searching sequence databases for homologous RNAs. See the
      <a class="ext" href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">Infernal</a> website.

    <h3>RNAalifold</h3>
    
    <p>
      Folds pre-computed alignments using a combination of free-energy and
      covariation measures. Part of the <a class="ext"
        href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/">Vienna package</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Seed alignment</h3>
    
    <p>
      A manually curated sample of representative sequences for a
      family. These sequences are aligned and annotated with a consensus
      secondary structure. This alignment is used to build the covariance
      model for the family.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Sequence region</h3>
 
    <p>
      A single segment of nucleotide sequence in our alignments. Multiple
      sequence regions from a single EMBL sequence may be in the same
      family.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Type</h3>
    
    <p>
      A simple functional classification we use for our families. This is
      our own ontology and does not current directly relate to the
      ontologies used by other databases. For a full list of our current
      ontologies see the help section on <span class="link"
      onclick="tabPage.switchTab('helpgetStartedBlock');">searching by family
      type</span>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Stockholm format</h3>

    <p>
      A multiple sequence alignment format used by Rfam (and Pfam) for the
      dissemination of protein and RNA sequence alignments. For more information
      see the <a class="ext"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format">
        Wikipedia article</a> on Stockholm format.

    <h3>WAR</h3>
    
    <p>
      A software tool that enables us to simultaneously run several
      different methods for performing multiple alignment and secondary
      structure prediction for non-coding RNA sequences. See the <a class="ext"
        href="http://genome.ku.dk/resources/war">WAR</a> website.
