# this one template should be able to generate two titles: the first ("tab") should
# be the one that appears inside the page, as the label for the "tab" that forms
# the page. This one can (and probably should) include HTML. The second title is the
# one that goes into the header of the HTML and will appear as the title for the 
# browser window or browser tab. This one shouldn't contain any HTML, and it will
# be prefixed with "Pfam: " in the page wrapper template.
