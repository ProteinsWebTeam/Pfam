        The wikipedia text that you see displayed on our web site is a download 
        from <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">
          Wikipedia</a>. This means that the information we display is a copy of 
        the information from the Wikipedia database. The button above 
        (&quot;Edit wikipedia entry&quot;) takes you to the edit page for the 
        article directly within wikipedia. You should be aware you are not 
        editing our local copy of this information. Any changes that you make 
        to the Wikipedia article will not be displayed by our site until we next 
        download the article from Wikipedia. We currently download new content 
        on a nightly basis.

      <h2>Before you edit for the first time</h2>

      <p>
        Wikipedia is a free, online encyclopedia. Although anyone can edit or 
        contribute to an article, Wikipedia has some strong editing guidelines 
        and policies, which promote the Wikipedia standard of style and 
        etiquette. Your edits and contributions are more likely to be accepted 
        (and remain) if they are in accordance with this policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should take a few minutes to view the following pages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">
              Five pillars</a></li>

      <h2>Things you should know</h2>
      
      <h3>How your contribution will be recorded</h3>

      <p>
        Anyone can edit a Wikipedia entry. You can do this either as a new user 
        or you can register with Wikipedia and log on. When you click on the 
        &quot;Edit Wikipedia entry&quot; button, your browser will direct you to 
        the edit page for this entry in Wikipedia. If you are a registered user 
        and currently logged in, your changes will be recorded under your 
        Wikipedia user name. However, if you are not a registered user or are 
        not logged on, your changes will be logged under your computer&rsquo;s IP 
        address. This has two main implications. Firstly, as a registered 
        Wikipedia user your edits are more likely seen as valuable contribution 
        (although all edits are open to community scrutiny regardless). 
        Secondly, if you edit under an IP address you may be sharing this IP 
        address with other users. If your IP address has previously been 
        blocked (due to being flagged as a source of 'vandalism') your edits 
        will also be blocked. You can find more information on this and creating 
        a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account"
          class="ext" >user account</a> at Wikipedia.

        and we will try to help.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Information we would like to see added</h3>
      
      <p>
        We would value contributions that are referenced directly to the primary 
        literature. Information on structure and function will be especially 
        valuable.
      </p>
      <p>      
        Adding references is made much easier by

        For a good example of what is possible in wikipedia, look at the 
        <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_ribozyme">

      <h3>Does Rfam agree with the content of the Wikipedia entry ?</h3>

      <p>
        Rfam has chosen to create Wikipedia entries for all of our RNA families 
        and to open them up to community annotation. While the original 
        Wikipedia article that we import was (in most cases) generated from Rfam 
        annotations, the Wikipedia article you see now may bear little 
        resemblance to that original text. The Wikipedia community does monitor 
        edits to try to ensure that (a) the quality of article annotation 
        increases, and (b) vandalism is very quickly dealt with. However, we 
        would like to emphasise that Rfam does not curate the Wikipedia entries 
        and we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information on the 
        Wikipedia page.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Contact us</h2>
      
      <p>
        The community annotation is a new facility of the Rfam web site. If you 
        have problems editing or experience problems with these pages please
