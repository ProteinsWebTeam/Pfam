=head2 METHODS

=head2 auto : Private

Checks for a sequence that should be used to pre-fill the search form.

=cut

sub auto : Private {
  my ( $this, $c ) = @_;

  # see if we should pre-fill the sequence field, based on the sequence that
  # was handed to us by the referring site
  
  # detaint it, naturally, and accept only sequences that are shorter than some
  # limit, which is set in the config
  if ( defined $c->req->param('preseq') and 
       $c->req->param('preseq') =~ m/^([A-Za-z]+)$/ and
       length( $1 ) < $this->{maxPrefillLength} ) {
    
    $c->log->debug( 'Search::auto: found a sequence with which to pre-fill the search form' )
      if $c->debug;

    # stash it and let the template stuff the value into the form    
    $c->stash->{preseq} = $1;
  }

  # check if the preseq should be handled as DNA rather than protein
  if ( defined $c->req->param('dnapreseq') and 
       $c->req->param('dnapreseq') =~ m/^([A-Za-z\>\_\-\s]+)$/ and

      if $c->debug;

    # stash it and let the template stuff the value into the form    
    $c->stash->{dnapreseq} = $1;
