=head1 METHODS

=head2 auto : Private

Adds the Pfam version data to the stash, so that it's accessible 
throughout the site.

=cut

sub auto : Private {
  my $this = shift;
  my ( $c ) = @_;

  # see if there's a maintenance message in the configuration file
  if ( $c->config->{maintenance} ) {
    $c->log->debug( 'found a maintenance message' )
      if $c->debug;

    $c->stash->{title}   = $c->config->{maintenance}->{title};
    $c->stash->{message} = $c->config->{maintenance}->{message};

    $c->stash->{template} = 'pages/maintenance.tt';

    # break out of the processing chain now and go straight to the "end" action
    return 0;
  }

  # see if we can get a DB ResultSet from the VERSION table, which is 
  # effectively a test of whether we can connect to the DB. If we can't, 
  # set the template to point to a page that will apologise and let the "end"
  # actin do its stuff
  eval {
    # stash some details of the Pfam release
    $c->stash->{relData} = $c->model( 'PfamDB::Version' )
                             ->search( {}, {} )
                             ->first;
  };
  if ( $@ ) {
    $c->stash->{template} = 'pages/db_down.tt';

    # break out of the processing chain now and go straight to the "end" action
    return 0;
  }
  
  # call the "auto" method on the super-class, which will do the work of
  # picking the correct tab for us
  return $c->SUPER::auto( @_ );
}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head2 index : Private

Generates the main site index page. This overrides the version from
PfamBase::Root, so that we can use cache_page for PfamWeb.

=cut

sub index : Private {
  my( $this, $c ) = @_;

  # # set the page to be cached for one week
  $c->cache_page( 604800 );

  # tell the navbar where we are
  $c->stash->{nav} = 'home';

  $c->log->debug('PfamWeb::index: generating site index') if $c->debug;
}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head2 blocked : Path

Displays a message telling the user that their access has been blocked for 
potentially abusive usage.

=cut

sub blocked : Global {
  my( $this, $c ) = @_;

  # # set the page to be cached for one week
  $c->cache_page( 604800 );

  $c->log->debug( 'Root::blocked: sending "blocked" message for IP: '
                  . $c->req->address ) if $c->debug;

  my $ip = $c->req->address;

  $c->res->status( 403 ); # Forbidden
  $c->res->content_type( 'text/plain' );
  $c->res->body( <<EOF );
