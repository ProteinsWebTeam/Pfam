=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration is done through a series of external "Apache-style"
configuration files.

=cut

# add to the configuration the name of the host that's actually serving
# the site and its process ID. These will be pulled out later in the header
# template
__PACKAGE__->config( server_name => hostname() );
__PACKAGE__->config( server_pid  => $$ );

# grab the location of the configuration file from the environment and
# detaint it. Doing this means we can configure the location of the
# config file in httpd.conf rather than in the code
my ( $conf ) = $ENV{PFAMWEB_CONFIG} =~ m/([\d\w\/-]+)/;

# set up the ConfigLoader plugin. Point to the configuration file
__PACKAGE__->config( 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' => { file => $conf } );

# read the configuration, configure the application and load these
# catalyst plugins
__PACKAGE__->setup( qw( HTML::Widget
                        Unicode
                        Static::Simple) );

# use Log4perl for logging to a separate log file. We need to set up the 
# l4p output using a config file, which we specify in the main server 
# config.
__PACKAGE__->log( Log::Log4perl::Catalyst->new( __PACKAGE__->config->{l4p_config} ) );
