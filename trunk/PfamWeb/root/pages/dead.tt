<h1>Dead Pfam-A family</h1>

<p>
  The Pfam-A family that you are trying to view is now a dead family. That
  means that it has been removed from the Pfam database and is no longer
  available through the website.
[% IF pfam.comment %]
  The family was removed for the following reason: 
</p>
<div class="dead_comment">
  [% pfam.comment %]
</div>
[% ELSE %]
</p>
[% END;
IF pfam.forward_to %]
<p>
  However, <strong>[% pfam.pfama_id %]</strong> ([% pfam.pfama_acc %]) has been
  replaced by or merged into 
  <a href="[% refreshUri %]"><strong>[% pfam.forward_to %]</strong></a>.  
</p>
<p>
  In [% refreshDelay ? refreshDelay : 5 -%] seconds you will be redirected to
  the Pfam family page for <a href="[% refreshUri %]">[% pfam.forward_to %]</a>, 
  or you can <a href="[% refreshUri %]">go there immediately</a>.
</p>
[% ELSE %]
<p>
  In [% refreshDelay ? refreshDelay : 5 -%] seconds you will be redirected to
  the Pfam home page, or you can <a href="[% refreshUri %]">go there immediately</a>.
</p>
[% END %]
