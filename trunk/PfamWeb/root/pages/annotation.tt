      CASE SUBMISSION_AJAX_FAILED %]
<h2>Submission failed</h2>
<p>
  There appears to have been a problem building the original submission form.
  In order to prevent automated scripts submitting nuisance messages via this
  form, we make an extra call to our server after the form has loaded into your
  browser. It looks as though there was a problem making that extra call and 
  therefore the server cannot validate your submission.
</p>
<p>
  If you believe that this is a problem with our server, please let us know
  via the email address below.
</p>
[%    CASE SUBMISSION_NO_COOKIE %]
<h2>No cookies</h2>
<p>
  In order to prevent automated scripts submitting nuisance messages via this 
  form, we use a cookie to check that submissions come from a real web browser.
  The cookie stores no personally identifiable information and is used once and
  once only, purely for the purpose of validating the form submission process. 
  The cookie is set to expire one hour after the form was initially loaded.
</p>
<p>
  Please make sure that you have cookies enabled in your browser and reload 
  the form. If you continue to have problems submitting your annotation once 
  you have enabled cookies and accepted cookies offered by the annotation form
  page, please let us know at the email address below.
</p>
[%    CASE SUBMISSION_MESSED_WITH %]
<h2>Suspicious form activity</h2>
<p>
  We take various steps to stop automated scripts submitting nuisance messages
  via this form and, during the processing of your comments, one of our checks
  failed.
</p>
<p>
  The server has determined that the form was submitted by a script, rather than
  by a regular user via a web browser.
</p>
<p>
  Please try again and if the submission continues to fail, please let us know
  via the email address below.
</p>
[%    CASE SUBMISSION_TIMED_OUT %]
<h2>Submission timed out</h2>
<p>
  In order to prevent automated scripts submitting nuisance messages via this
  form, we set a time limit of one hour on the submission process. The server
  has decided that you took more than one hour to complete and submit the form
  and it has therefore rejected the submission.
</p>
<p>
  However, when this page was reloaded, the time limit was reset and you should
  now be able to submit this form successfully. If you continue to have problems
  with submission, please let us know via the email address below.
</p>
[%    CASE SUBMISSION_INVALID %]
<h2>Invalid submission</h2>
<p>
  There was a problem with one or more of the values that you entered into the
  form. Please check the messages beside the form fields and correct any problems
  that are highlighted. If you believe you have corrected the problems that
  were highlighted but still can't submit the annotation, please let us know
  via the email address below.
</p> 
[%    CASE SUBMISSION_EMAIL_FAILED %]
<h2>Submission failed</h2>
<p>
  There was a problem submitting your annotation to the Pfam group. It's 
  possible that this was due to a problem with our email or tracking systems 
  and everything may work correctly next time. Please try again in a little 
  while. If you continue to have problems submitting your annotation, please
  let us know via the email address below.

      Please complete the form to submit an annotation to the Pfam group. 
      Please supply information for all of the fields marked with a &quot;*&quot;.
      When you submit the form, your annotation will be entered into our
      request tracking system and you should receive an email at the 
      address that you specify, giving you some information on how you can 
      keep track of the progress of your submission.

      After submitting the form, you should see a page confirming that your 
      comments have been accepted, and you will then be redirected, after a
