<hr />

<p>
  The logo image that you have requested is very large ([% logo_x %] &times;
  [% logo_y %] pixels) and you appear to be using a 
  <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(layout_engine)">
    Gecko-based</a> web browser, such as Mozilla or Firefox.
  Very large PNG images are 
  <a class="ext" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=427385">
    known</a> to crash Gecko-based browsers, under some circumstances. This
  logo image has therefore not been automatically loaded.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to try displaying the logo anyway, you can 
  <span class="link" id="overrideLink">override</span> 
  the test for image size. <strong>Please note</strong> that this may crash your
  browser !
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to 
  <a href="[% c.uri_for( '/family/' _ acc _ '/logo_image', { dl => 1 } ) %]">
    download</a> the image, you can save the image and view it locally. 
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // <![CDATA[

  // add a listener to the "override" link, which replaces this whole chunk
  // of text with an <img> tag that will load the image
  $("overrideLink").observe( "click", function() {
    console.log( "clicked override link" );
    var img = new Element( "img", 
                            {
                              alt: "", 
                              src: "[% c.uri_for( '/family/' _ acc _ '/logo_image' ) %]"
                            } );
    $("logo").update( img );
  } );
