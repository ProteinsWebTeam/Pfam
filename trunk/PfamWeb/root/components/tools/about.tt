<h2>Version [% version ? version : "21.0" %]</h2>
<h3>Released [% reldate ? reldate : "Nov 2006" %]</h3>

<p>
  The Pfam website is developed on linux and is tested during
  development using recent builds of <a target="new"
	href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>, the latest
  incarnation of the Mozilla web browser. It is also tested
  regularly in <a target="new"
	href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer</a>, 
  running on Windows, and <a target="new" 
      href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a> on Mac OS X.
</p>
<p>
  The current site has been checked in the following versions of
  these browsers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firefox v1.5.0.7</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer v6 and v7</li>
  <li>Safari v1.3.1</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Whilst we make every effort to ensure that the Pfam site will
  work well with most browsers, older versions in particular will
  not always render pages correctly. If you are having problems
  with the site, please consider upgrading to a recent version of
  your chosen browser.
