      This chart is a modified &quot;sunburst&quot; visualisation of
      the species tree for this family. It shows each node in the
      tree as a separate arc, arranged radially with the superkingdoms
      at the centre and the species arrayed around the outermost
      ring.
    </p>

    <h2>How the sunburst is generated</h2>

    <p>
      The tree is built by considering the taxonomic lineage of each
      sequence that has a match to this family. For each node in the
      resulting tree, we draw an arc in the sunburst. The radius of
      the arc, its distance from the root node at the centre of the
      sunburst, shows the taxonomic level (&quot;superkingdom&quot;,
      &quot;kingdom&quot;, etc). The length of the arc represents
      either the number of sequences represented at a given level, or
      the number of species that are found beneath the node in the
      tree. The weighting scheme can be changed using the sunburst
      controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to reduce the complexity of the representation, we 
      reduce the number of taxonomic levels that we show. We consider
      only the following eight major taxonomic levels:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>superkingdom</li>
      <li>kingdom</li>
      <li>phylum</li>
      <li>class</li>
      <li>order</li>
      <li>family</li>
      <li>genus</li>
      <li>species</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Colouring and labels</h2>

    <p>
      Segments of the tree are coloured approximately according to
      their superkingdom. For example, archeal branches are coloured
      with shades of orange, eukaryotes in shades of purple, etc. The
      colour assignments are shown under the sunburst controls. Where
      space allows, the name of the taxonomic level will be written on
      the arc itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you move your mouse across the sunburst, the current node
      will be highlighted. In the top section of the controls panel we
      show a summary of the lineage of the currently highlighed node.
      If you pause over an arc, a tooltip will be shown, giving the
      name of the taxonomic level in the title and a summary of the
      number of sequences and species below that node in the tree. 
    </p>

    <h2>Anomalies in the taxonomy tree</h2>

    <p>
      There are some situations that the sunburst tree cannot easily
      handle and for which we have work-arounds in place.
    </p>

    <h3>Missing taxonomic levels</h3>

    <p>
      Some species in the taxonomic tree may not have one or more of
      the main eight levels that we display. For example, <em>Bos
      taurus</em> is not assigned an order in the NCBI taxonomic tree.
      In such cases we mark the omitted level with, for example,
      &quot;No order&quot;, in both the tooltip and the lineage
      summary.
    </p>

    <h3>Unmapped species names</h3>
    
    <p>
      The tree is built by looking at each sequence in the full
      alignment for the family. We take the name of the species given
      by UniProt and try to map that to the full taxonomic tree from
      NCBI. In some cases, the name chosen by UniProt does not map to
      any node in the NCBI tree, perhaps because the chosen name is
      listed as a synonym or a misspelling in the NCBI taxonomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that these nodes are not simply omitted from the sunburst
      tree, we group them together in a separate branch (or segment of
      the sunburst tree). Since we cannot determine the lineage for
      these unmapped species, we show all levels between the
      superkingdom and the species as &quot;uncategorised&quot;.
    </p>

    <h3>Sub-species</h3>

    <p>
      Since we reduce the species tree to only the eight main
      taxonomic levels, sequences that are mapped to the sub-species
      level in the tree would not normally be shown. Rather than leave
      out these species, we map them instead to their parent species.
      So, for example, for sequences belonging to one of the
      <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> sub-species in the NCBI taxonomy, we
      show them instead as belonging to the species <em>Vibrio
      cholerae</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Too many species/sequences</h3>

    <p>
      For large species trees, you may see blank regions in the outer
      layers of the sunburst. These occur when there are large numbers
      of arcs to be drawn in a small space. If an arc is less than
      approximately one pixel wide, it will not be drawn and the space
      will be left blank. You may still be able to get some
      information about the species in that region by moving your mouse
      across the area, but since each arc will be very small, it will
      be difficult to accurately locate a particular species.
