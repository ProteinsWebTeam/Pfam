    <h2>Species trees</h2>
    <p>
      We show the species tree in one of two ways. For smaller trees we try
      to show an interactive representation, which allows you to select
      specific nodes in the tree and view them as an alignment or as a set 
      of Pfam domain graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately we have found that there are problems viewing the 
      interactive tree when the it becomes larger than a certain limit. 
      Furthermore, we have found that Internet Explorer can become 
      unresponsive when viewing some trees, regardless of their size. 
      We therefore show a text representation of the species tree when the
      size is above a certain limit or if you are using Internet Explorer
      to view the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using IE you can still load the interactive tree by 
      clicking the &quot;Generate interactive tree&quot; button, but please 
      be aware of the potential problems that the interactive species tree 
      can cause.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Interactive tree</h3>
    <p>
      For all of the domain matches in a full alignment, we count the 
      number that are found on all sequences in the alignment. 
      This total is shown in the <span class="domSum">purple</span> box.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also count the number of unique sequences on which each domain is 
      found, which is shown in <span class="seqSum">green</span>.
      <strong>Note</strong> that a domain may appear multiple times on the
      same sequence, leading to the difference between these two numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we group sequences from the same organism according to the 
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><acronym 
      title="National Center for Biotechnology Information">NCBI</acronym></a> 
      code that is assigned by
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, 
      allowing us to count the number of distinct sequences on which the 
      domain is found. This value is shown in the <span class="specSum">
        pink</span> boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the NCBI species tree to group organisms according to their 
      taxonomy and this forms the structure of the displayed tree.
      <strong>Note</strong> that in some cases the trees are too large (have
      too many nodes) to allow us to build an interactive tree, but in most
      cases you can still view the tree in a plain text, non-interactive
      representation. Those species which are represented in the seed
      alignment for this domain are <span class="highlightSeed">
        highlighted</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the tree controls to manipulate how the interactive tree
      is displayed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>show/hide the summary boxes</li>
      <li>highlight species that are represented in the seed alignment</li>
      <li>expand/collapse the tree or expand it to a given depth</li>
      <li>select a sub-tree or a set of species within the tree and view
        them graphically or as an alignment</li>
      <li>save a plain text representation of the tree</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Please note:</strong> for large trees this can take some time.
    While the tree is loading, you can safely switch away from this
    tab but if you browse away from the family page entirely, the tree
    will not be loaded.
