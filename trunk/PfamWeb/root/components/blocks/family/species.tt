        This tree shows the occurrence of this domain across different species.
        <span onclick="reveal( this, 'speciesNotes', false, true )"

        <p>
          For all of the domain matches in a full alignment we count the 
          number of domains that are found on all sequences in the alignment. 
          This total is shown in the <span class="domSum">purple</span> box.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also count the number of unique sequences on which each domain is 
          found, which is shown in <span class="seqSum">green</span>.
          <strong>Note</strong> that a domain may appear multiple times on the
          same sequence, leading to the difference between these two numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we group sequences from the same organism according to the 
          <a class="ext" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><acronym 
          title="National Center for Biotechnology Information">NCBI</acronym></a> 
          code that is assigned by
          <a class="ext" href="http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, 
          allowing us to count the number of distinct sequences on which the 
          domain is found. This value is shown in the <span class="specSum">
            pink</span> boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the NCBI species tree to group organisms according to their 
          taxonomy and this forms the structure of the displayed tree.
          <strong>Note</strong> that in some cases the trees are too large (have
          too many nodes) to allow us to build an interactive tree, but in most
          cases you can still view the tree in a plain text, non-interactive
          representation. Those species which are represented in the seed
          alignment for this domain are <span class="highlightSeed">
            highlighted</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the tree controls to manipulate how the interactive tree
          is displayed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>show/hide the summary boxes</li>
          <li>highlight species that are represented in the seed alignment</li>
          <li>expand/collapse the tree or expand it to a given depth</li>
          <li>select a sub-tree or a set of species within the tree and view
            them graphically or as an alignment</li>
          <li>save a plain text representation of the tree</li>
        </ul>
