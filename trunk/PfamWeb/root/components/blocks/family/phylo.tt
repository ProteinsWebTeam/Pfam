      This page displays the phylogenetic tree for this family's seed
      alignment. We use 
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/">FastTree</a> 
      to calculate neighbour join trees with a local bootstrap based on 100
      resamples (shown next to the tree nodes). FastTree calculates
      approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from our seed
      alignment.
