        Relationships between families in a clan are determined using
        <a class="ext" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15531603">
          HHsearch</a>. Families are deemed to be closely
        related if their E-value is less than 10<sup>-3</sup> and these 
        relationships are shown with a solid line. Less closely related
        family pairs, with an E-value of between 10<sup>-3</sup> and
        10<sup>-1</sup>, are shown with a dashed line.
      </p>
      <p>
        The E-value for each pair of closely or partially related families
        is shown next to the line linking the families. Clicking on the 
        E-value will take you to the pairwise 
        <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/logomat-p/"
           class="ext">HMM-logo</a> for that relationship.
        You can see the information regarding a Pfam family by clicking
        on the family box.
