    <p>
      For those sequences which have a structure in the
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.wwpdb.org/">Protein DataBank</a>, we
      use the mapping between <a class="ext" 
        href="http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, PDB and Pfam coordinate
      systems from the <a class="ext" 
        href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/">MSD</a> group, to allow us to map
      Pfam domains onto UniProt three-dimensional structures. The table below
      shows the structures on which <strong>[% pfam.pfamB_acc %]</strong>
      has been found.
