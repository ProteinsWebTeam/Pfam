    <h3><a name="whatispfam">What is Pfam ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      Pfam is a collection of multiple sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov
      models (HMMs). Each Pfam HMM represents a protein family or domain. By
      searching a protein sequence against the Pfam library of HMMs, you can determine
      which domains it carries i.e. its domain architecture. Pfam can also be used to
      analyse proteomes and questions of more complex domain architectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each Pfam accession we have a family page, which can be accessed in several
      ways: from the 'View a Pfam Family' search box on the HOME page, by clicking on
      any graphical image of a domain, by searching for a particular family using the
      'Keyword Search' box on the top right hand corner of most website pages, or by
      pasting the family identifier or accession into the 'JUMP TO' box that is 
      present on most pages in the site.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="family">What is on a Pfam-A family page ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      From the family page you can view the Pfam annotation for a family. We
      also provide access to many other sources of information, including
      annotation from the <a class="ext"
        href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">InterPro</a> database, where
      available, cross-links to other databases and other tools for protein
      analysis. Since release 25.0 we have also started displaying relevant
      articles from <a class="ext"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> where available. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Via the tabs on the left-hand side of the page, you can view:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the domain architectures in which this family is found</li>
      <li>the alignments for the family in various formats, including alignments of
        matches to the NCBI and metagenomic sets, as well as in 'heat-map' format.
        All alignments can be downloaded</li>
      <li>the phylogenetic and species distribution trees, either as a traditional,
        interactive tree or as a &quot;sunburst&quot; plot</li>
      <li>the HMM logo</li>
      <li>the structural information for each family where available</li>
    </ul> 
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="clan">What is a clan ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      Some of the Pfam families are grouped into <em>clans</em>. Pfam defines a
      clan as a collection of families that have arisen from a single
      evolutionary origin. Evidence of their evolutionary relationship can be in
      the form of similarity in tertiary structures, or, when structures are not
      available, from common sequence motifs. The seed alignments for all families
      within a clan are aligned and the resulting alignment (called the clan
      alignment) can be accessed from a link on the clan page. Each clan page
      includes a clan alignment, a description of the clan and database links,
      where appropriate. The clan pages can be accessed by following a link from
      the family page, or alternatively they can be accessed by clicking on
      'clans' under the 'browse' by menu on the top of any Pfam page.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="clanBuilding">What criteria do you use for putting families into clans ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      We use a variety of measures. Where possible we do use structures to guide 
      us and that is always the gold standard. In the absence of a structure we
      use:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>profile comparisons such as HHsearch</li>
      <li>the fact that a sequence significantly matches two HMMs in the same 
        region of the sequence</li>
      <li>a method called SCOOP, that looks for common matches in search results 
        that may indicate a relationship</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      All of this sort of information is then used by one of our curators to make 
      a decision about where families are related and we strive to find information 
      in literature that support the relationship, e.g. common function.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="wise">I was wondering if it is possible to build Wise2 with HMMER3 
		  support ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
			The way we get round the problem with the difference in HMMER versions,
			is to convert the HMMs that are in HMMER3 format to HMMER2 format using
			the HMMER3 program &quot;hmconvert&quot; (with -2) flag. To make the 
			searches feasible, we screen the DNA for potential domains using 
			ncbi-blast and the Pfam-A.fasta as a target library. GeneWise is then 
			used to calculate a subset of HMMs against the DNA. There is some 
			down-weighting of the bits-per-position between H2 and H3 HMMs that the 
			conversion does not account for, leading inevitably to some false 
			negatives for some families/sequences. However, until GeneWise is patched 
			to deal with HMMER3 models, this is the best course of action.
		</p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="lsfs">What happened to the Pfam_ls and Pfam_fs files?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      In the past, each Pfam family was represented by two profile-hidden Markov
      models (HMMs). One of these could match partially to a family and was
      called local or fs mode, the other required a sequence to match to the
      whole length of the HMM, and was called glocal or ls mode. With HMMER2, we
      found that the combination of the two models gave us the most sensitive
      searches.  However, HMMER3 models are only available for searching in local
      (fs) mode.  Because of the improvements in HMMER3, this single model is as
      sensitive as the two combined HMMER2 models. This means that we no longer
      provide two HMM libraries called 'HMM_ls' and 'HMM_fs'. Instead, a single
      library is available called 'Pfam-A.hmm'.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="dnaSearch">Can I search DNA against Pfam ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      The Wise2 software package allows the comparison of protein HMMs to genomic
      DNA. We use this package to allow users to search single DNA sequences
      against the library of Pfam HMMs. Paste your DNA sequence into the DNA 
      search box on the
      <a href="[% c.uri_for('/search', tab='searchDnaBlock') %]">search page</a>.
      The results take approximately 2 minutes for
      a 1kb sequence, and approximately 1 hour for a 80kb sequence. 
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="localSearch">How can I search Pfam locally ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      If you have a large number of sequences or you don't want to post your
      sequence across the web, you can search your sequence locally using the
      'pfam_scan.pl' script.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of HMMs and formats, Pfam is based around the <a class="ext"
      href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER3</a> package. This will need to be
      installed on your local machine. You will need also to download the Pfam
      HMM libraries from the FTP site, as well as a few modules from CPAN, most
      notably Moose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full details on how to get 'pfam_scan.pl' up and running can be found on
      our <a class="ext"
      href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/Tools/README"> FTP site</a>.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="noSeq">Why doesn't Pfam include my sequence ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      Pfam is built from a fixed release of UniProt. At each Pfam release we
      incorporate sequences from the latest release of UniProt. This means that,
      at any time, the sequences used by Pfam might be several months behind those
      in the most up-to-date versions of the sequence databases. If your sequence
      isn't in Pfam, you can still find out what domains it contains by pasting it
      into the sequence search box on the 
      <a href="[% c.uri_for('/search') %]">search page</a>.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="whyDup">Why is there apparent redundancy of UniProt IDs in the full-length FASTA sequence file ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      A given Pfam family may match a single protein sequence multiple times,
      if the domain/family is a repeating unit, for example, or when the HMM
      matches only to short stretches of the sequence but matches several
      times. In such cases the FASTA file with the full length sequences will
      contain multiple copies of the same sequence.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="howMany">How many accurate alignments do you have ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      Release [% relData.pfam_release %] has [% relData.number_families %]
      families. Over <strong>[% relData.pfama_coverage %]%</strong> of the
      proteins in SWISSPROT [% relData.swiss_prot_version %] and TrEMBL
      [% relData.trembl_version %] have at least one match to a Pfam-A family.

    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="submit">How can I submit a new domain ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      If you know of a domain that is not present in Pfam, you can
      submit it to us by email 
      (<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#102;&#097;&#109;&#045;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#064;&#101;&#098;&#105;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;">&#112;&#102;&#097;&#109;&#045;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#064;&#101;&#098;&#105;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a>)
      and we will endeavour to build a Pfam entry
      for it. We ask that you supply us with a multiple sequence
      alignment of the domain (please send the alignment file as a
      text file (e.g. <code>.txt</code>) and <strong>not</strong> in the format of
      a specific application such as Microsoft Word (e.g. a <code>.doc</code>) 
      file), and associated literature evidence if available.

    <h3><a name="ipfam">What is iPfam ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      iPfam is a resource that describes domain-domain interactions
      that are observed in PDB entries. Where two or more Pfam
      domains occur in a single structure, it analyses them to see if
      the are close enough to form an interaction. If they are close
      enough it calculates the bonds forming the interaction. Further
      information can be found on the iPfam help pages.
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
  
    <h3><a name="mySearch">Can I search my protein against Pfam ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      Of course! Please use  
      <a href="[% c.uri_for( "/search", { tab = "searchProteinBlock" } ) %]">this</a> 
      search form. 
    </p>
    <p><a class="link" rel="faqTop">back to top</a></p>
    
    <h3><a name="gaps">What is the difference between the - and . characters in 
    your full alignments ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      The &#39;-&#39; and &#39;.&#39; characters both represent gap 
      characters. However they do tell you some extra information about how the 
      HMM has generated the alignment. The &#39;-&#39; symbols are where the 
      alignment of the sequence has used a delete state in the HMM to jump past a 
      match state. This means that the sequence is missing a column that the HMM 
      was expecting to be there. The &#39;.&#39; character is used to pad gaps 
      where one sequence in the alignment has sequence from the HMMs insert state. 
      See the alignment below where both characters are used. The HMM states 
      emitting each column are shown. Note that residues emitted from the 
      <em>Insert</em> (I) state are in lower case.

      We are very keen to be alerted to new domains. If you can

    <h3><a name="other">Are there other databases which do this ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      To a certain extent yes, there are a number of &quot;second generation&quot;
      databases which are trying to organise protein space into evolutionarily
      conserved regions. Examples include:
    </p>

    <h3><a name="best">So which database is better ?</a></h3>
  
    <p>
      As with everything, it depends on your problem: we would
      certainly suggest using more than one method. Pfam is likely to
      provide more interpretable results, with crisp definitions of
      domains in a protein.
