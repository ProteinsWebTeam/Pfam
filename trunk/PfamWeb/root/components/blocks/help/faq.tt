	<h3><a name="whatispfam">What is Pfam ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Pfam is a collection of multiple sequence alignments and profile
	  hidden Markov models (HMMs).  Each Pfam HMM represents a protein
	  family or domain.  By searching a protein sequence against our
	  the Pfam library of HMMs you can find out its domain
	  architecture.  You can also use Pfam to analyse proteomes and
	  domain architectures.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For each Pfam entry we have a family page which can be accessed
	  in several ways; by following links for a particular
	  family/domain on the website, clicking on a graphical image of a
	  domain and by searching for a particular family using the search
	  box on the Pfam website. From the family page you can view the
	  alignments and annotation (including annotation from the
	  InterPro database where available), view the species
	  distribution of a domain, access cross-links to other databases
	  and use other tools for protein analysis.  We display structural
	  information for each family where available.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="diffs">What is the difference between Pfam-A and Pfam-B 
	families ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Pfam contains two types of families, Pfam-A and Pfam-B.  Pfam-A
	  families are manually curated HMM based families which we build
	  using an alignment of a small number of representative sequences
	  (we call this alignment the 'seed' alignment).  We manually set
	  a threshold value for each HMM, and this determines the minimum
	  score a sequence must attain to belong to the family.  We search
	  all of our HMMs against the <a
	  href="http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/index.shtml">UniProt</a>
	  database, and include all sequences that score above the cut-off
	  value for a particular family in the family's full alignment.
	  For each family we build two HMMs, one to represent fragment
	  matches and one to represent full length matches. We use the
	  HMMER2 software to build and search our profile HMMs.  Pfam-A
	  matches are very unlikely to be false matches.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To complement the Pfam-A families, we automatically generate
	  Pfam-B families using the <a
	  href="http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/home.php">PRODOM</a>
	  database. Pfam-B families are formed by taking alignments of
	  sequence segments from PRODOM, and removing any Pfam-A residues
	  from them. Some Pfam-B families are composed of low complexity
	  regions and may not reflect true relationships, therefore we
	  recommend you verify that sequences in a Pfam-B family are
	  related by using other methods such as BLAST.
	</p>
	<p>
	  All families in Pfam are non-overlapping such that no amino acid
	  belongs to more that one family/domain.  At each Pfam release we
	  search all of our models against an updated version of UniProt,
	  and regenerate our Pfam-B families using the most recent version
	  of PRODOM.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="clan">What is a clan ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Some of the Pfam families are grouped into 'clans'. Pfam defines
	  a clan as a collection of families that have arisen from a
	  single evolutionary origin. Evidence of their evolutionary
	  relationship can be in the form of similarity in tertiary
	  structures, or when structures are not available, by common
	  sequence motifs. The seed alignments for all families within a
	  clan are aligned and the resulting alignment (called the clan
	  alignment) can be accessed from a link on the clan page.  Each
	  clan page includes a clan alignment, a description of the clan
	  and database links where appropriate. The clan pages can be
	  accessed by following a link from the family page, or
	  alternatively they can be accessed by clicking on 'clans' under
	  the 'browse' by menu on tab on any Pfam page.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="twoHmms">Why are there two HMMs foreach Pfam entry ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  For each Pfam entry we build two HMMs, one to represent full
	  length matches (ls model), and one to represent fragment matches
	  (fs model).  When you search a protein on our site we search
	  them against both the ls and fs models.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="dnaSearch">Can I search DNA against Pfam ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  The Wise2 software package allows the comparison of protein HMMs
	  to genomic DNA.  We use this package to allow users to search
	  single DNA sequences against the library of Pfam HMMs. To do
	  this, you will need to go to the Pfam website hosted at the
	  Sanger Institute and paste your DNA sequence in the DNA search
	  box on the search page. The results take approximately 2 minutes
	  for a 1kb sequence, and approximately 1 hours for a 80kb
	  sequence.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="submit">How can I submit a new domain ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  If you know of a domain that is not present in Pfam, you can
	  submit it to us by email (<a href="mailto:pfam@sanger.ac.uk">
		Pfam email</a>) and we will endeavour to build a Pfam entry
	  for it.  We ask that you supply us with a multiple sequence
	  alignment of the domain (please send the alignment file as a
	  text file (eg. .txt) and not in the format of a specific
	  application such as a Word (.doc) document), and associated
	  literature evidence if available.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="ipfam">What is iPfam ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  iPfam is a resource that describes domain-domain interactions
	  that are observed in PDB entries.  Where two or more Pfam
	  domains occur in a single structure, it analyses them to see if
	  the are close enough to form an interaction.  If they are close
	  enough it calculates the bonds forming the interaction. Further
	  information can be found on the iPfam help pages.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="localSearch">How can I search Pfam locally ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  If you have a large number of sequences, or your boss will not
	  allow you to post your sequence across the web you can search
	  your sequence locally. Please see the help page on 
	  <a href="[% c.uri_for( "/help", tab="helpGetStartedBlock" ) %]">
	    getting started</a> with Pfam.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="noSeq">Why doesn't Pfam doesn't include my sequence ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Pfam is built from a fixed release of UniProt.  At each Pfam
	  release we incorporate sequences from the latest release of
	  UniProt.  This means that at any time the sequences used by Pfam
	  could be several months behind those in the most up-to-date
	  versions of the sequence databases.  If your sequence isn't in
	  Pfam you can still find out what domains it contains by pasting
	  it into the search box in Pfam.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="family">What's on the family page ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Each family has the following data:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		A <em>seed alignment</em> which is a hand edited multiple
		alignment representing the family.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <em>Hidden Markov Models (HMM)</em> derived from the seed
	    alignment, which can be used to find new members of the domain
	    and also take a set of sequences to realign them to the
	    model. One HMM is in ls mode (global) the other is an fs mode
	    (local) model.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		 A <em>full alignment</em> which is an automatic alignment of
		 all the examples of the domain using the two HMMs to find and
		 then align the sequences.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<em>Annotation</em> that contains a brief description of the
		domain, links to other databases and some Pfam specific
		data. To record how the family was constructed.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="howMany">How many accurate alignments do you have ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Release 7.0 has 3,360 families. Over 69% of the proteins in
	  SWISSPROT 40 and TrEMBL-18 have at least one match to a Pfam-A
	  family.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="mySearch">Can I search my protein against Pfam ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Of course! Please use one of the two servers listed below.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<a href="[% c.uri_for( "/seqsearch", tab="searchProteinBlock" ) %]">
		  Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (UK)</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="http://pfam.janelia.org/">Washington D.C. (USA)</a>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="transSearch">Can I search my dna sequence in translation against
	Pfam ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  Yes you can, on the <a href="[% c.uri_for( "/seqsearch", tab="searchDnaBlock" ) %]">
	    DNA search page</a>.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>
	
	<h3><a name="gaps">What is the difference between the - and . characters in 
	your full alignments ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  The - and . characters both represent gap characters.  However
	  they do tell you some extra information about how the HMM has
	  generated the alignment. The - symbols are where the alignment
	  of the sequence has used a delete state in the HMM to jump past
	  a match state.  This means that the sequence is missing a column
	  that the HMM was expecting to be there.  The . character is used
	  to pad gaps where one sequence in the alignment has sequence
	  from the HMMs insert state. See the alignment below where both
	  characters are used.  The HMM states emitting each column are
	  shown. Note that residues emitted from the Insert (I) state are
	  in lower case.

	<h3><a name="sssa">What do the SS and SA lines in the alignment mean ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  These lines are structural information. The SS stands for
	  secondary structure, and this is taken from DSSP. The following list
	  gives the definitions for each code letter:
	</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt>C</dt>
	  <dd>Random Coil</dd>
	  <dt>H</dt>
	  <dd>Alpha-helix</dd>
	  <dt>G</dt>
	  <dd>3(10) helix</dd>
	  <dt>I</dt>
	  <dd>Pi-helix</dd>
	  <dt>E</dt>
	  <dd>Hydrogen bonded beta-strand (extended strand)</dd>
	  <dt>B</dt>
	  <dd>Residue in isolated beta-bridge</dd>
	  <dt>T</dt>
	  <dd>H-bonded turn (3-turn, 4-turn, or 5-turn)</dd>
	  <dt>S</dt>
	  <dd>Bend (five-residue bend centered at residue i)</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	  The SA stands for surface accessibility. It is expressed on a
	  scale between 0 and 9 where 0 is a buried residue and 9 is a
	  solvent exposed residue.
	</p>

	<p>

	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="missing">You don't have domain YYYY in Pfam !</a></h3>

	<p>
	  We are very keen to be alerted to new domains. If you can
	  provide us with a multiple alignment then we will try hard to
	  incorporate it into the database. If you know of a domain, but
	  don't have a multiple alignment, we still want to know, for
	  simple families just one sequence is enough. Again E-mail <a
	  href="mailto:pfam@sanger.ac.uk">Pfam</a>.
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3>Can we have this running sensibly locally. Do you have
	software to support Pfam locally?</h3>

	<p>
	  In terms on HMMs and formats, Pfam is based around the <a
	  href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER2</a> package. This will
	  need to be installed on your local machine, and you will need to
	  also download the Pfam HMM libraries from the FTP site. These
	  files are called Pfam_ls (global models) and Pfam_fs (fragment
	  models).
	</p>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="other">Are there other databases which do this ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  To a certain extent yes, they are a number of &quot;second
	  generation&quot; databases which are trying to organise the
	  protein database into evolutionary conserved regions. Examples
	  include:
	</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><a href="http://www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/PFSCAN_form.html">
	    PROSITE</a></dt>
	  <dd>This originally was based around regular expression patterns
	  but now also includes profiles.</dd>
	  <dt><a href="http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/dbbrowser/PRINTS/">PRINTS</a></dt>
	  <dd>This is based around protein &quot;finger-prints&quot; of a series of
	  small conserved motifs making up a domain.</dd>
	  <dt><a href="http://www.blocks.fhcrc.org/">BLOCKS</a></dt>
	  <dd>This is based around automatic ungapped alignments.</dd>
	  <dt><a href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">SMART</a></dt>
	  <dd>This is a database concentrating on extracellular modules
	  and signaling domains.</dd>
	  <dt><a href="http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodom.html">PRODOM</a></dt>
	  <dd>This is an automatically generated domain database based on PSI-BLAST
	   searching.</dd>
	  <dt><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro">InterPro</a></dt>
	  <dd>Combines information from Pfam, Prints, SMART, Prosite and PRODOM.</dd>
	  <dt><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml">CDD</a></dt>
	  <dd>The Conserved Domain Database is derived from Pfam and SMART databases.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p><a href="#faqTop">back to top</a></p>

	<h3><a name="best">So which database is better ?</a></h3>

	<p>
	  As with everything, it depends on your problem: I would
	  certainly suggest using more than one method. Pfam is likely to
	  provide more interpretable results with crisp definitions of
	  domains in a protein.
