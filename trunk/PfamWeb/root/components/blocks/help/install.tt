    <h1>Pfam website virtual machine</h1>

  <div class="blockContent">

    <p>
      Installing the website has always been somewhat complex and we no longer
      support direct installation of the site. Instead, we have built a 
      <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">
        virtual machine</a> that includes all of the software needed to run 
      the Pfam website within your local environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find instructions on downloading and installing the VM on a
      set of <a href="[% c.uri_for( '/vm' ) %]">dedicated pages</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can still find the source code for the website and the ancillary
      systems in our
      <a class="ext" href="http://subversion.apache.org/">SVN</a> repository,
      at <a class="ext" href="http://pfamsvn.sanger.ac.uk/"><code>
        http://pfamsvn.sanger.ac.uk/</code></a>.
