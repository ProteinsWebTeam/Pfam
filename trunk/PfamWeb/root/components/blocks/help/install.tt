      <h2>Documentation update</h2>
      <h3>October 2009</h3>
      <p>
        The documentation in this tab is currently out of date. Although
        the general information is still largely accurate, the details of 
        the site and underlying database may be inaccurate. We hope to update
        the documentation within the coming weeks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The source code for this website and the ancillary systems that it uses
      are all freely available for download. The website is designed to be 
      portable, so that it can be installed and run at your local site if
      required. This section gives an overview of the requirements for 
      running the site, a brief description of the steps involved in installing
      it, and links to detailed installation instructions.       
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    
    <h3>Software</h3>
    
    <p>
      The site is written in entirely in perl, using the 
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> web
      framework. It runs under <a class="ext" href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a> 
      in the <a class="ext" href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> 
      web-server. All data are retrieved from 
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> databases, running
      locally. Sequence searches are performed by a separate job queuing system, 
      which uses various third-party software to perform searches, generate 
      alignments, etc., including 
      <a class="ext" href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER</a>, 
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Wise2/">genewise</a> and 
      <a class="ext" href="http://blast.wustl.edu/">wublast</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Hardware resources</h3>
  
    <p>
      The hardware requirements for the whole system are significant. Although
      it is possible to install all components on a single machine, we would
      not recommend it. Ideally you should have one or more web-server 
      machines, a separate database server, and one or more machines to serve
      the back-end job queuing system. That said, although we give an idea of 
      the hardware that we use at WTSI below, a local installation could be run 
      on a significantly lower specification system.
    </p>      

    <h4>Web server</h4>
    
    <p>
      The Pfam website includes mainly dynamically generated pages, with a large
      number of statically served items. The best performance can be gained by
      separating the two kinds of data onto two (or more) separate machines,
      so that dynamic data are served by one server, static data by another.
      If this is not possible, a single large machine should still give 
      resonable performance. We serve a development site from a 3GHz Intel Xeon
      with 4Gb of physical memory.
    </p>

    <h4>Database server</h4>
    
    <p>
      You will first need a reasonable amount of disk space for the database 
      files. The database is distributed as a set of gzip-compressed table
      dumps, which total about 12Gb. Once uncompressed these table files take up
      around 35Gb and once the tables are installed into MySQL, the database 
      will require around 150Gb of disk space.
    </p>
    <p>      
      The MySQL database daemon will run happily on most machines, but in order
      to get the performance required to serve the website, you will need a 
      machine with a fast processor (preferably multiple processors) and a large
      amount of memory. We run our database on a four processor AMD Opteron
      280 server with 8Gb of physical memory.
    </p>

    <h4>Queuing system</h4>

    <p>
      Our job queuing system can be run on the same machine as the website or
      database server, but we would recommend running it on a separate machine 
      or, ideally, on a farm of machines. This will ensure that the site can 
      handle multiple requests for sequence alignments, sequence searches, etc.
      We run our queuing system on a farm of 14 dual-core 2.8GHz Xeons, each
      with 4Gb of physical memory.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    
    <p>
      You will need to install three sub-systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the MySQL databases</li>
      <li>the back-end job queuing system</li>
      <li>the website itself</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Database</h4>
      
    <ol>
      <li>If you don't have it already, install MySQL</li>
      <li>Download the database files from the WTSI FTP site</li>
      <li>Install the database tables in your MySQL server</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Back-end</h4>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Install the required third-party software such as HMMER</li>
      <li>Install the perl prerequisites</li>
      <li>Download the data files for running the offline searches</li>
      <li>Retrieve the queuing system code from CVS</li>
      <li>Configure and start the queues</li>
    </ol>      
      
    <h4>Website</h4>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Configure <tt>cpan</tt></li>
      <li>Install catalyst</li>
      <li>Install perl prerequisites for the website</li>
      <li>Retrieve the website code from CVS</li>
      <li>Configure the website</li>
      <li>Configure apache</li>
      <li>Restart apache</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Detailed installation instructions</h3>
    
    <p>
      The process of installing the three sub-systems is described in detail
      in three
