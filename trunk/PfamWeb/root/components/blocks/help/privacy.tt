    <p>
      This section outlines the ways in which the Pfam website handles 
      information about users. This should not be read as a legal document, but 
      as a description of how we handle information that could be considered 
      sensitive. It should be read in conjunction with the privacy policy 
      documents of the individual Pfam consortium member sites. If you have any 
      concerns about the way that information is used in the website, please 
      contact us at the address given at the bottom of the page and we will be 
      more than happy to discuss your concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we make every possible effort to keep this site and the data
      that it manipulates safe and secure, we make <strong>no claim</strong> to 
      be able to protect sensitive or privileged information. If you are at all 
      concerned about sensitive information being released, please do not use 
      the site and consider installing the Pfam database and/or this website 
      locally.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Browsing</h2>
    
    <p>
      All web servers maintain fairly detailed logs of their activity. This
      includes keeping a record of every request that they serve, usually along
      with the <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">
        IP address</a> of the client that made the request. This is true of the
      web servers that host the Pfam websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although our servers do collect information about your IP address during 
      the normal process of serving the Pfam website, we do not use this 
      information explicitly. The Pfam group uses server logs
      <strong>only</strong> to help with development and debugging of the site.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Searches</h2>

    <p>
      The sequence search feature of the site allows you to upload a protein
      or DNA sequence to be searched against our library of HMMs. The 
      sequence that you upload is stored in a database and is retrieved by a
      set of scripts that actually perform the search. Although we do not 
      have any information that could be used to link that sequence to you 
      personally, you should be aware that the sequence itself <strong>is 
        accessible</strong> to systems administrators and other users who 
      maintain the Pfam site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The batch search function allows you to submit larger searches, the 
      results of which are emailed to you. Obviously, this requires you to 
      provide identifiable information, namely an email address. However, 
      beyond the routine backups of our databases, we do
      <strong>not</strong> store any information about email addresses and 
      sequences in the longer term and we make no attempt to keep track of 
      the searches that a particular user may be performing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information from other types of search, such as a keyword search, is
      held only in the web server logs but, as described above, no attempt is 
      made to interpret these logs except as part of development or debugging 
      of the site.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      We use <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">
        cookies</a> to maintain some information about you between your visits 
      to the site. The information that is stored cannot be used to identify you 
      personally and cannot be used to track your usage of the site.
    </p>
    <p>      
      If you are at all concerned about the use of cookies in the Pfam site, 
      you are free to block all cookies from this site and you should not 
      experience any problems. You may see some unintended behaviour, such as 
      being notified of all new features every time you visit the index page, 
      but the core functionality of the site should be unaffected.
