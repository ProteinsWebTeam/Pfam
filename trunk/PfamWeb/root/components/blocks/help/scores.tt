      <h2>Documentation update</h2>
      <h3>October 2009</h3>
      <p>
        The documentation in this tab is currently out of date. Although
        the general information is still largely accurate, the details of 
        the site and underlying database may be inaccurate. We hope to update
        the documentation within the coming weeks.

  	<h3>What Pfam HMM scores mean</h3>
  
  	<p>
  	  Pfam-A is based around hidden Markov model (HMM) searches, as
  	  provided by the <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER2</a>
  	  package.  In HMMER2, like BLAST, E-values (expectation values)
  	  are calculated.  The E-value is the number of hits that would be
  	  expected to have a score equal or better than this by chance
  	  alone. A good E-value is much less than 1. Around 1 is what we
  	  expect just by chance. In principle, all you need to decide on
  	  the significance of a match is the E-value.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	  However, there are a few complications. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	  The most serious complication is that there are no analytical
  	  results available for accurately determining E-values for gapped
  	  alignments, especially profile HMM alignments. HMMER uses
  	  empirical methods to estimate E-values. These methods are
  	  generally rather accurate. However, when in doubt, HMMER tends
  	  to err on the conservative side.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	  We use a second, and even more empirical, system in maintaining
  	  Pfam models. This system is implemented in the Pfam database
  	  rather than in the HMMER software. For each Pfam family, we
  	  record a &quot;trusted cutoff&quot; and a &quot;noise 
  	  cutoff&quot;, TC1 and NC1. TC1
  	  is the lowest score for sequences we included in the family
  	  (e.g. in the Full alignment).  NC1 is the highest score for
  	  sequences we did not include in the Full alignment. (Since Full
  	  alignments are produced automatically, the trusted sequence
  	  cutoff is always greater than the noise sequence cutoff.)
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	  Therefore, we can consider a hit very significant if it scores
  	  better than the trusted cutoff, better than the noise cutoff,
  	  and has a significant E-value. Sometimes sequences score better
  	  than the cutoffs though they don't have significant E-values;
  	  these are marginal hits that we've chosen to include in the
  	  family.
  	</p>
  
  	<h3>Sequence versus domain scores</h3>
  
  	<p>
  	  There's one additional wrinkle in the scoring scheme. HMMER2
  	  calculates two kinds of scores. The &quot;sequence
  	  classification score&quot; is the <i>total</i> score of a
  	  sequence aligned to a model; if there are more than one domain,
  	  the sequence score is the sum of all (finding multiple domains
  	  increases our confidence that the sequence belongs to that
  	  protein family, even if each domain individually is a weak
  	  match.) The &quot;domain score&quot; is a score for a single
  	  domain (these two scores are identical for single domain
  	  proteins).
