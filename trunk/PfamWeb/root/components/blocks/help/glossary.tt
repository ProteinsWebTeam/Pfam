    <h1>Glossary of terms used in Pfam</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="blockContent">

    <p>
      These are some of the commonly used terms in the Pfam website.			
    </p>

    <h3>Alignment coordinates</h3>

    <p>
      HMMER3 reports two sets of domain coordinates for each profile HMM match.
      The <em>envelope coordinates</em> delineate the region on the sequence
      where the match has been probabilistically determined to lie, whereas the
      <em>alignment coordinates</em> delineate the region over which HMMER is
      confident that the alignment of the sequence to the profile HMM is
      correct. Our full alignments contain the envelope coordinates from
      HMMER3.
    </p>

    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    
    <p>The collection of domains that are present on a protein.</p>

    <h3>Clan</h3>

    <p>
      A collection of related Pfam entries. The relationship may be defined 
      by similarity of sequence, structure or profile-HMM.
    </p>

    <h3>Domain</h3>
    
    <p>
      A structural unit which can be found in multiple protein contexts.
    </p>

    <h3>Domain score</h3>
    
    <p>
      The score of a single domain aligned to an HMM. Note that, for HMMER2, if
      there was more than one domain, the <em>sequence score</em> was the sum
      of all the domain scores for that Pfam entry. This is not quite true for
      HMMER3.
    </p>

    <h3>DUF</h3>
    
    <p>
      Domain of unknown function.
    </p>

    <h3>Envelope coordinates</h3>

    <p>
      See <strong>Alignment coordinates</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Family</h3>
    
    <p>
      A collection of related proteins.
    </p>

    <h3>Full alignment</h3>
    
    <p>
      An alignment of the set of related sequences which score higher than 
      the manually set threshold values for the HMMs of a particular Pfam 
      entry.
    </p>

    <h3>Gathering threshold (GA)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Also called the gathering cut-off, this value is the search threshold 
      used to build the full alignment. The GA is the minimum score a sequence 
      must attain in order to belong the the full alignment of a Pfam entry. 
      For each Pfam HMM we have two GA cutoff values, a sequence cutoff and 
      a domain cutoff.
    </p>

    <h3>HMMER</h3>
    
    <p>
      The suite of programs that Pfam uses to build and search HMMs. For Pfam
      release 24.0 we have used HMMER version 3 to make Pfam. See the 
      <a class="ext" href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER</a> site for more
      information.
    </p>

    <h3>Hidden Markov model (HMM)</h3>
    
    <p>
      A HMM is a probablistic model. In Pfam we use HMMs to transform the 
      information contained within a multiple sequence alignment into a 
      position-specific scoring system. We search our HMMs against the 
      <a class="ext "href="http://www.uniprot.org/index.shtml">UniProt</a>
      protein database to find homologous sequences.
    </p>

    <h3>HMMER3</h3>
    
    <p>
      The suite of programs that Pfam uses to build and search HMMs. See 
      the <a class="ext" href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER</a> site
      for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>iPfam</h3>
    
    <p>
      A resource that describes domain-domain interactions that are observed 
      in PDB entries. Where two or more Pfam domains occur in a single 
      structure, it analyses them to see if the are close enough to form an 
      interaction. If they are close enough it calculates the bonds forming 
      the interaction.
    </p> 

    <h3>Metaseq</h3>
    
    <p>
      A collection of sequences derived from various metagenomics datasets.
    </p>

    <h3>Motif</h3>
    
    <p>
      A short unit found outside globular domains.
    </p>

    <h3>Noise cutoff (NC)</h3>
    
    <p>
      The bit scores of the highest scoring match not in the full alignment.
    </p>

    <h3>Pfam-A</h3>
    
    <p>
      A HMM based hand curated Pfam entry which is built using a small number 
      of representative sequences. We manually set a threshold value for each
      HMM and search our models against the 
      <a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a> database. All of the 
      sequnces which score above the threshold for a Pfam entry are included in 
      the entry's full alignment.
    </p>

    <h3>Pfam-B</h3>
    
    <p>
      An automatically generated alignment which is formed by taking a cluster
      of sequences from the 
      <a href="http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/sqgraph/pairsdb/index_html"
          class="ext">ADDA</a> database and removing Pfam-A residues from
      them. Since Pfam-B families are automatically generated, we recommend that
      you verify that the sequences in a Pfam-B family are related, using other
      methods such as BLAST. For Pfam 24.0, we have made HMMs for the first
      (and therefore largest) 20,000 Pfam-B familes. Users can search their
      sequences against the Pfam-B HMMs in addition to the Pfam-A HMMs when
      performing both single-sequence searches and batch searches on the
      website.
    </p>

    <h3>Posterior probability</h3>
    
    <p>
      HMMER3 reports a <em>posterior probability</em> for each residue that
      matches a 'match' or 'insert' state in the profile HMM. A high posterior
      probability shows that the alignment of the amino acid to the
      match/insert state is likely to be correct, whereas a low posterior
      probability indicates that there is alignment uncertainty.  This is
      indicated on a scale with '*' being 10, the highest certainty, down to 1
      being complete uncertainty. Within Pfam we display this information as a
      heat map view, where green residues indicate high posterior probability,
      and red ones indicate a lower posterior probability.
    </p>

    <h3>Repeat</h3>
    
    <p>
      A short unit which is unstable in isolation but forms a stable structure 
      when multiple copies are present.
    </p>

    <h3>Seed alignment</h3>
    
    <p>
      An alignment of a set of representative sequences for a Pfam entry. We 
      use this alignment to construct the HMMs for the Pfam entry.
    </p> 

    <h3>Sequence score</h3>
    
    <p>
      The total score of a sequence aligned to a HMM. If there is more than 
      one domain, the sequence score is the sum of all the domain scores for 
      that Pfam entry. If there is only a single domain, the sequence and the 
      domains score for the protein will be identical. We use the sequence 
      score to determine whether a sequence belongs to the full alignment of 
      a particular Pfam entry.
    </p>

    <h3>Trusted cutoff (TC)</h3>
    
    <p>
      The bit scores of the lowest scoring match in the full alignment.
    </p>
