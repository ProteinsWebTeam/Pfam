    <h3>Contact Pfam</h3>
    <p>
      You can contact us in various ways. Each of the Pfam consortium sites 
      provides a contact email address, which you can find at the bottom
      of every page. You can use this address to contact the specific Pfam 
      group.
    </p>      
    <p>
      We also run a central 
      <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#102;&#097;&#109;&#045;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#064;&#101;&#098;&#105;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;">helpdesk</a>,
      which handles annotation comments, data enquiries and general problems 
      with the Pfam websites. We use a request tracking system to monitor emails 
      to the helpdesk, so you should receive an automated response to your 
      email, letting you know that the system has logged your mail and notified 
      us of its arrival.
    </p>
