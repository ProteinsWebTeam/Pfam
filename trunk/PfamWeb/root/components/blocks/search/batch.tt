      <h1>Search queues paused</h1>

      <p>
        Pfam batch and DNA searches are managed by a job queuing system. On Monday 9th
        May 2011 we will be performing essential software upgrades to this queuing
        system, which will require us to stop and empty the queues entirely. In order
        to avoid searches being lost, we have now paused the submission of new search
        jobs through the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although you can continue to submit jobs, no new jobs will be run from 6pm
        Sunday 8th May 2011 (GMT) until the completion of the work. This means that
        there will be a delay of between 12 and 24 hours in returning job results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience. If you have any concerns
        about this work, please contact us at 
        <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#102;&#97;&#109;&#45;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#64;&#115;&#97;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#112;&#102;&#97;&#109;&#45;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#64;&#115;&#97;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a>.

      Upload a FASTA-format file containing multiple protein sequences to be 
      searched for matching Pfam families. Results of the search will be 
      returned to you at the email address that you specify. Please check the 
      <span onclick="reveal($('batchNotesSwitch'),'batchNotes',false, true)" 
            class="link">notes</span>
      below for the restrictions on uploaded sequence files.

            class="moreLink" 
            onclick="reveal(this,'batchNotes',false, true);">More...</span>
    </p>

    <div id="batchNotes" style="display: none">

      <h2>File contents</h2>
      
      <p>
        We accept only <strong>protein sequences</strong> and your uploaded file
        must conform to a fairly strict interpretation of the 
        <a class="ext" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/fasta.shtml">
          FASTA file format</a>. 
        We apply the following checks to the format of uploaded sequence files. 
        Files that do not conform to the following rules will be rejected by
        the server
      </p>

      <h3>File contents</h3>
      
      <p>
        Files must contain only header lines and sequence lines. Header lines, 
        which begin with &quot;&gt;&quot;, can be used to describe the sequence 
        that follows. There is no fixed format for header lines but we restrict 
        the characters that are allowed. If your header lines contain any of the 
        following characters, your file will be rejected:
      </p>
      <strong><code>; \ ! *</code></strong>
      <p>
        Note that we explicitly include the semi-colon (;) in the list of 
        forbidden characters, although this may be used to denote comments in 
        some versions of the FASTA-format. Please do not use comments in the 
        FASTA files that you upload here.
      </p>

      <h3>Header rows</h3>

      <p>
        Batch searches are run using our <strong>pfam_scan.pl</strong> script,
        which uses programs from the HMMER suite. These treat the first
        &quot;word&quot; on the header line as the ID for a sequence. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        The ID is taken to be the characters after the initial &quot;&gt;&quot;
        and before the first whitespace character. The sequence IDs must be
        unique and your uploaded sequence file will be rejected if we find the
        same ID for multiple sequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Header rows must not have any whitespace between the &quot;&gt;&quot;
        and the remainder of the header row. Header rows must also have
        content; files with blank header lines will not be accepted.
      </p> 

      <h3>Sequence symbols</h3>

      <p>
        Your sequence should be a <strong>valid protein sequence</strong>. As 
        such, the sequence line should contain only amino-acid symbols, i.e. 
        capital letters excluding &quot;J&quot;. In the context of a Pfam 
        search gaps and translation stops have little meaning and should not 
        normally be used, but we do accept &quot;-&quot; or &quot;*&quot; to 
        denote gaps and translation stops respectively. Nucleotide sequences
        are not considered valid and will be rejected.
      </p>

      <h2>Service limits</h2>
      
      <p>
        Searches run on a &quot;compute farm&quot; with a limited number of 
        &quot;slots&quot;. Each search takes one slot and once all slots are
        in use, new jobs wait in a queue for the next slot to become free. In 
        order to prevent large jobs occupying slots for very long periods, 
        which can impact the availability of the system for other users, we 
        place a number of restrictions on the size of job that we will accept. 
      </p>

      <h3>File size</h3>
        
      <p>
        Files must have fewer than<strong> 500,000</strong> lines and fewer than 
        <strong>5000</strong> sequences.  
      </p>

      <h3>Sequence length</h3>
      
      <p>
        Each sequence must be between <strong>6</strong> and <strong>20000</strong>
        amino-acids in length.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Sequence variation</h3>
      
      <p>
        We use heuristics to check that a sequence has a reasonable level of 
        variation, in order to prevent large strings of identical sequence or
        a large number of duplicate residues being searched. If you find that 
        you cannot submit a valid sequence because of this restriction, please 
        let us know.
      </p>

      <h2>E-value limit</h2>
      
      <p>
        If you specify an E-value cut-off for your search, that E-value must
        be a positive number.
      </p>
