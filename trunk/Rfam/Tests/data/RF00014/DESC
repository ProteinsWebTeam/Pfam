CC   DsrA RNA regulates both transcription, by overcoming transcriptional
CC   silencing by the nucleoid-associated H-NS protein, and translation,
CC   by promoting efficient translation of the stress sigma factor, RpoS.
CC   These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first
CC   of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS
CC   translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop
CC   is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation.
CC   The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can
CC   be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of
CC   either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is
CC   complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA,
CC   suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important
CC   for translational regulation.
