CC   DsrA RNA regulates both transcription, by overcoming transcriptional
CC   silencing by the nucleoid-associated H-NS protein, and translation, by
CC   promoting efficient translation of the stress sigma factor, RpoS. These
CC   two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three
CC   stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but
CC   not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for
CC   antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop,
CC   which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp
CC   transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The
CC   sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream
CC   leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with
CC   the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation.
