Synopsis

Takes one or more seed alignment and searches each against the collection of Pfam
HMMs using hhsearch. Note, we have to use alignments as it appears that hhsearch
has some serious issues estbliashing E-values for HMMER3 formated HMMs. Also, this
should give you the best sensitivity as it is using native formats. The hhm-style
HMMs are constrcutruted using a method that keeps them as close to HMMER3 as possible.

This will generate a results file for you to inspect. 

Example:

1. You are building a new family and want to search it

$0 --seed --name 'CoolDom'

2. You want to search a family in the database

$0 --acc PF00001

3. You have a MSA and want to see if it is related to anything in database

$0 --file 'userAlignment' 

4. You want to generate a new hhm-style library

$0 --onlylib

5. You want to generate a new hhm-style libary and search the database. Note this
   will take some time and generate the library first. 

$0 --newlib --acc PF00001

6. You want to perform an all against all search. This script will only finish/exit
when all jobs have completed. If you find that there are no jobs running, then
look at the logs in the statusdir. Restarting the script with the same parameters,
should allow it to recover from the point in time. The results will be stored in
the statusdir, with a results file for each chunk.

$0 --allVsall --statusdir /tmp
