  Synopsis
  ========
  Checks out the family from the SVN repository. Takes the current id and replaces it with the
  new family name specified on the command line. The old (current) id is added to the DESC file
  as a PI line (or appended on).

  Family names must conform to the following pattern [\\w_-]{1,15}. i.e. between 1 and 15 
  alpha-numeric characters and/or the following symbols: '_' '-'
  
  Note: If you are at WTSI/EBI, you can use family ids instead of accessions.
  
  If you are told to remove a wikipedia line and really do not want to, use the -wiki flag.
