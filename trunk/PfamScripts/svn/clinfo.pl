 clan_info.pl  - fetches the latest clandesc file and revision information for a clan.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  clan_info.pl  - fetches the latest clandesc file and revision information for a clan.
                  Enter the clan accession on the command line, entering nothing will 
                  print the help message. Finally, if you are lucky, it will try and work
                  out the clan accession if you pass in the identifier.
