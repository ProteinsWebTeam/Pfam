This script can be used to build a Pfam-A family.  It can be run from
one of two starting points:

(1) a fasta file or a seed alignment - the script will run pfbuild on
    the seed alignment, or a seed alignment that it generates from a
    fasta file.

(2) a 'Pfam-A' like directory which contains a SEED, PFAMOUT and ALIGN
    file - the script will perform an overlap check and, if there are
    no overlaps, it will iterate the family by generating a new SEED
    file from the ALIGN file and running pfbuild.  If the 'extend'
    option is chosen, the script will try and extend the alignment as
    much as possible in both the N and C direction without allowing
    overlaps between the envelope co-odinates of any Pfam-A families.

    You should run the script multiple times on the same directories
    and eventually the script will move each directory into an
    'Overlaps' directory, or to a 'Built' directory, both of which
    will be created in the current working directory.  The family will
    need to undergo a set number of iterations (default of 2), in
    addition to having no overlaps, before it gets moved to the Built
    directory.  If there are no overlaps, and the iteration process
    has not increased the number of members in the ALIGN file, no
    further iterations will be performed and the directory is moved to
    the Built directory.  You should keep running the script
    periodically until all families are either in the 'Built' or
    'Overlaps' directory.

USAGE: 

     $0 (-directory <directory containing families> or -list <list file of directories> or -family <single directory>)

REQUIRED OPTIONS for starting point (1) (Choose one of the following):
----------------------------------------      

     -fasta  <fasta_file_of_multiple_sequences>     create the seed from this fasta file - give either the 
                                                    filename here if it is the same for each directory, or 
                                                    the extension of the sequence file if it is not.
                                                    (e.g. -fasta "seqs.fasta" or -fasta ".fasta")

     -seed <name of SEED file>                      use this file as SEED file - give either the 
                                                    filename here if it is the same for each directory, or 
                                                    the extension of the sequence file if it is not.
                                                    (e.g. -SEED "seqs.msa" or -SEED ".msa")


ADDITIONAL OPTIONS for starting point (1):
------------------------------------------
     -author <author_list>                          list of authors to put in the DESC file
     -seed_source <seed_source>                     seed source to put in the DESC file


EXAMPLE for starting point (1):
   $0 -directory . -fasta ".fa" -author "TIGRFAMs, Finn RD" -seed_source "TIGRFAMS (release 2.0)" 
 


ADDITIONAL OPTIONS for starting point (2):
------------------------------------------

     -author <author_list>                          list of authors to put in the DESC file
     -seed_source <seed_source>                     seed source to put in the DESC file
     -max_iterations <number>                       maximum number of iterations to run (default is 2)
     -extend                                        extend the alignment in both N and C directions as much as possible 
                                                    without allowing overlaps with any Pfam-A families

EXAMPLE for starting point (2):
   $0 -directory . -max_iterations 3
