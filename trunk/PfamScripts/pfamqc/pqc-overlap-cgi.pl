This script runs checks for overlaps between a Pfam family and the
current Pfam database (pfamlive).  However, this script is brokered 
through the pfamsvn and should be used by those who can not get
direct connection to the database.  Proxy it take from PFAM_CONFIG file
or environment settings.

Usage:

    $0 <family> -i family1 -i family2

Example:

    $0 AAA -ignore other_AAA
