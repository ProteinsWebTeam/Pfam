This script runs checks for overlaps between a Pfam family and the
current Pfam database (pfamlive).


Usage:

    $0 <family>


Addional options:

  -add_to_clan <clan_accession>       :Adds family to clan
  -remove_from_clan <clan_accession>  :Removes family from clan
  -i <family_name>                    :Ignore this family (-i can occur multiple times)
  -e                                  :Find end points of extensions


  

Example:

    $0 AAA -remove_from_clan CL0023

EOF

  exit(0);
}
