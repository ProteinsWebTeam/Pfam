  <h2>Search tips</h2>

  <p>
    Here are a few tips on how to get the most out of the Pfam sequence 
    search system:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>
      use a valid sequence
    </dt>
    <dd>
      although we check that the sequence contains only valid characters,
      we can&apos;t check that it&apos;s a <em>sensible</em> sequence. If you
      are cutting and pasting the sequence, make sure you copy the correct
      piece of text into the form
    </dd>
    <dt>
      used a valid job-ID
    </dt>
    <dd>
      if you bookmarked a set of results, make sure that it includes the 
      job-ID parameter for the results that you need to save
    </dd>
    <dt>
      check that the job-ID hasn&apos;t expired
    </dt>
    <dd>
      we store job results for one week, so you can only use the bookmark for 
      a results page for a short time. If you need to permanently record your
      results, please save the page locally 
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="back">
    Go <a href="[% base %]search?tab=searchSequenceBlock">back</a> to the 
    search form and try another sequence.
  </p>
