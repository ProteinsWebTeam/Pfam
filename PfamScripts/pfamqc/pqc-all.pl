Performs all QC checks on the family:
Checks the format of the files for any issues;
Checks the sequences in the SEED and ALIGN files (as in 'pqc-seqs <PFAM ACCESSION>')
Checks the alignments for overlaps with filtering set (as in 'pqc-overlap-rdb -filter <PFAM ACCESSION>');
  The filter is set so that overlaps with a length of <20\% of the lowest scoring matching region length
  will be permitted (i.e. filtered) if they form <1\% of the regions in the ALIGN file.
  Filtering params are set on \$PFAM_CONFIG (overlap_rule field).
Checks the Seed has no fragments, is not ragged, and has no missing sequences;
Checks authors and references;
